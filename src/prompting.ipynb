      "\n",
      " High Automation Potential: AI virtual staging can fully automate the process of virtually staging a property, eliminating the need for manual labor, furniture selection, and physical setup.\n",
      " Wide Applicability: It can be applied to a wide range of properties, from vacant homes to those with existing furniture. \n",

      " Efficiency Gains: Virtual staging can be completed significantly faster than traditional methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there might still be some human input required for fine-tuning and specific adjustments, the core process of generating realistic virtual staging is highly automated.
