Example 3: A nonprofit event coordinator uses the platform to manage event registration, collect payments, and send out event-related communications. This simplifies event planning and allows for better communication with attendees.  ONET JOB automated 3: Event Planners who manage event registration, collect payments, and send out event-related communications. ONET JOB: Event Planners Confidence Interval 3: 7 Reasoning 3: The scenario highlights tasks commonly performed by event coordinators, specifically focusing on registration and communication management. While the platform may not cover all aspects of event planning, it effectively automates these specific tasks. \n"
