We solve the problem of asymmetry of the information that generates three main problems in the second-hand motorcycle market: 1. Lack of trust between buyer and seller 2. Low average motorcycle price: also if the motorcycle is in perfect conditions 3. Low or null value of motorcycles accessories and modifications Motoblockchain offers a Motorcycle Digital Identity based on privacy by design and DLT technologies: it collects the documentation about the history of the motorcycles and it uses Blockchain to make it tamper proof, while giving to the user full control over it in a full GDPR compliant system. Owners can save all the information related with motorcycle’s life in our platform that is constantly connected with the Blockchain: owner’s history, mileage in time, invoices and money invested in modifications, accessories, improvements, revisions, as well as all the photos of the related components. We access motorcycle data with the MOBD (patented) IOT system equipped with OBD II connection and IOT sensors: it makes the motorcycle autonomously update data into the Digital Identity. The MOBD additionally provides several disruptive functionalities designed to improve user's safety and collected in one unified IOT tool. We use AI-on-chip to do predictive failure anytime the motorcycle is started, we provide remote failure detection so that mechanics can remotely diagnose failures and prevent accidents, we provide incident detection and emergency call (eCall) services), we use Big Data & AI to analyze the data recorded and to provide recommendations, singularities, trend calculations, behaviour patterns to assurance companies and motorcycle manufacturers (OEM). Every user can decide the level of privacy of each document, he can decide with whom to share it and finally he can use it to create trust with the buyer so generating added value during the sales process. The Digital Identity created is inherited by the new owner after that the motorcycle sales ends. The Motorcycle Digital Identity system creates trust and provides symmetry of the information between users, consequently it solves all problems mentioned above.\",\n",

Further optimization is achieved by overlaying nearby traffic patterns and current weather conditions. - We have partnered with tree planting organizations to help companies with their carbon neutrality initiatives. A percentage of our sales revenue will be used to plant trees and offset our customers' carbon footprint. - We have a data exchange protocol to help producers with their digital transformation initiatives to reduce paper-based workflows and increase efficiencies. - Our modular sensor design aligns with the Circular Economy thesis.

As a woman-owned small business, our company is known for it values, diversity, inclusion and parity. Even as an early stage startup, we walk the talk with women engineers making up more than 50% of our technical workforce. The number of people in the US living with cognitive impairment (including Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementia) is over 5.8M today and is expected to increase to nearly 14M by 2050. The rapidly growing population of informal caregivers (more than 16M today) of people with cognitive impairment is subject to high stress due to patient behavioral symptoms, increased demands on caregiver time, and lack of adequate care-giving knowledge to address changing patient conditions. Caregivers face depleted income due to reduced productivity, higher use of health care services, decreased quality of life, higher burnout and risk of earlier mortality. The economic value of the caregivers' time spent providing more than 8.5 billion hours of care is estimated to be nearly $234 billion. Amicus Brain’s AI-led services focus on caregivers and their patients before, during and after diagnosis, and while living with the disease, providing a scalable, cost-effective solution that reduces the caregiver load, raises the standard of current practices in neurodegenerative care and leads to improved health outcomes.\",\n",

Also, we hope to provide the civilian community of India with a novel package delivery systems that will decrease the time it takes to ship product drastically. Currently, we are a team of 2 people, Ayush Jindal and Vibhu Tripathi. Both are engineers in their final semester who have come together with a common goal of putting Vizzbee in the list of top startups and benefiting the society along the way. Ayush is a B.Tech in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi, while Vibhu is a B.Tech Mechanical Engineer from RGPV Bhopal. Both share a passion for Robotics and bring about a tangible improvement in the world by deploying latest advances in technology. Vizzbee is currently focussed on developing autonomous technology that will be deployed in the areas of disaster and used by the army and other task forces for mapping the combing through it to find people, animals and other valuable objects. The images obtained from such scenes can also aid in 3D reconstruction which will provide better insights in a disaster, helping authorities define causes and perpetrators. Such a system can be used in a train wreck or road crash for both search and rescue as well as forensic analysis. It was this vision of Vizzbee that caught the attention of a Hong Kong based investor, Zeroth SPC. They invited Vizzbee to be a part of their 3 months long accelerator program, all set to provide aid to the founders for realising this dream of theirs. They saw the technology as a force of tomorrow in making today. With this positive boost at so soon into our company realisation, we hope to achieve and do justice to our aims and play a vital role in influencing the technological revolution happening all around us.',\n",

SIDIS Health modules allow organizations to rapidly grow revenue-generating locations and services while significantly reducing the related operational costs and increasing cash flow velocity on claims. The organization shifts from supporting all services manually using software to monitoring the software for exceptions and targeting resources at those areas until the AI learns how to continue automated handling of those exceptions. Care quality is able to be tracked at the metadata level by fully integrating each organization's unique curriculum and treatment plans into Sidis Health, vastly increasing transparency into treatment progress and the ability to continue receiving re-authorizations from insurance payers and utilizing the data collected to negotiate better rates and eventually help establish value-based reimbursements within Autism & ABA therapies. Treatment plan progress for patients is tracked by AI to compare similar patient profiles and identify variables that indicate specific patients are progressing better or faster than others and can identify where case managers should pay the most attention and the AI could even suggest alternative options to consider for more effective outcomes. Sidis Health enables direct care providers and case managers to focus on the detailed data driving their treatment decisions while allowing support staff to focus on their standardized workflows to support revenue generation. Corporate functions are provided with access to all collected transactional and operational data in a real-time offline replicated database with open APIs to facilitate integration with internal or 3rd party BI tools, providing the ultimate visibility into the business without the need for custom integrations\",\n",

Alex communicates directly with your tenants and takes care of the transactional “busy work” - every Property Manager can essentially have their very own digital Property Assistant. Users interact with Alex via existing channels – including Messenger, SMS, email and soon voice. There are no portals and logins - which is driving user-adoption. Our property management customers are finding that 62% of all tenant requests are being raised via Alex (and largely automated) which is reducing their email and phone traffic.

       "  \"PITCH MomSays connects moms together by interest and location so they get the products they need. Moms are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of products out there. Therefore, moms find it easier to get what they need through recommendations. Our platform allows brands to market and sell to moms through recommendations of other moms. This is a $2 trillion industry in the U.S.A alone and we currently have 40,000 users per month with 100,000 visitors a month. We work with an average of 5 brands a month and we are post-revenue. PROBLEM|OPPORTUNITY Current Challenge: Moms are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of products available to them so they rely on trusted recommendations to buy their products. The companies, on the other hand, spend a lot of time and effort trying to capture the attention of the busy mom. SOLUTION|PRODUCT A platform that connects moms to their products through storytelling. Our unique way of selling speaks from a viewpoint of moms for moms without having to advertise. Therefore, the content the moms choose to read will seamlessly provide matching products so they can buy it on the platform. BUSINESS MODEL The moms around the world access the marketplace for free and the brands pay to market and sell to their desired audience (based on location and interests). Brands select campaigns to market their products to boost recommendations and pay a monthly fee to manage their inventory. COMPETITORS and DIFFERENTIATION Competitors include other mom networks like smilemom.com, content providers like babble.com as well as generic event apps. Our differentiation is we market through storytelling written by moms and connect brands through campaigns and events all in one. TECHNOLOGY and SCALABILITY The technology is the web platform that connects with moms around the world with a smartphone. This enables us to provide user-centric content desired by the audience based on their interests and location. This also allows multiple campaigns and localized sales to be run concurrently for the desired location. The site currently has a reach in 6 countries and can reach out worldwide to tap a market that is worth $1 trillion. EXECUTION PLAN|GO TO MARKET STRATEGY We are currently live and operating post-revenue and our strategy is to make this a platform available to any brand that needs to sell to moms around the world based on interest and location. We want to build a community-driven marketplace for moms that leverages the existing readers and allow vendors to manage their own inventory of products and target their desired audience by interest and location. Our platform would ultimately combine the power of moms' reviews with e-commerce that will facilitate the type of products and services that moms get to buy based on recommendations.\",\n",

Our solution reveals forgery and falsification of images and videos with high accuracy. Images and videos that were taken out of context and reused with modified metadata, so called shallow fakes have been around for some time, however the advancement of AI and wide availability of CPU/GPU power has enabled bad actors to easily forge videos, that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones and can be used for malicious and unethical purposes. Videos have been regarded as proof that something has happened; however, today anyone can swap faces of politicians or other people just by following a step-by-step guide available online. With time, this will only get easier and videos like these can spread like wildfire on social media, just like fake news in 2016, but now on steroids, in the form of fake videos. This could possibly happen already in 2020, just in time for the next US elections. Our solution allows media outlets (online, TV, news agencies, journalists) and platforms (social media sites, video sharing platforms and websites) to check the authenticity of images and videos, preventing misinformation of the public and all unwanted consequences related to forged content. The uniqueness of our solution relies on bundling different state-of-the-art technologies: forensic image analysis, metadata validation, reverse image search, AI, machine learning, digital watermarking and blockchain verification.',\n",

While those methods may help collectors get more organized, it still neglects the largest pain point, time. Maintaining inventory accuracy with traditional systems requires regular auditing and very little margin for error, otherwise the entire system is rendered useless. It can easily take up to 25 person-hours to audit a 1,000 bottle cellar, and thousands of dollars to outsource the tedious job to a third party. Even still, inaccurate inventories, missed drinking windows, lost bottles, and inaccurate collection valuations are issues that have plagued even the most well maintained cellars. While we at CellarEye love that wine is steeped in history and tradition, we also recognize that tradition need not be followed when it comes to the logistics of enjoyment. By applying cutting edge computer vision technology and sophisticated intelligent software to wine cellar inventory management, we are offering collector’s the opportunity to do more of what they love most, collecting and drinking world class wine. As collectors and wine industry professionals ourselves, our entire mission at CellarEye is to offer collectors complete control of their cellars with the lowest user input required.

Seen the large number of signals to interpret in order to assess customer trust when it comes to payment, we have developed a Predictive Risk Management solution (PRIM) that can be applied to any Debt Portfolio. Thanks to specific algorithms we created and thanks to Artificial Intelligence, PRIM uses companies’ data to predict whether their customers will pay and when, as well as to assess the risk of their debt portfolio. In other words, by projecting today’s debt portfolio in the future and applying a specific risk model on top of it, it determines the next best actions that are to be taken to collect the cash, reduce bad debts and reduce the overall risk of debts portfolios. Portfolios are segmented according to specific types of risks, customers can be alerted when a payer changes its behaviors and payers behaviors can be compared among specific payers groups within the company or within a specific industry (among customer peers).

       "  \"The modern push for environmentally-conscience devices, spurred on by consumer demand and government regulation, has forced companies to either adapt or die. As early as 2008, the UK was considering a ban on patio heaters, with an estimated economic impact in the UK alone of up to 250M euros in lost revenue per year to the pubs, restaurants, and caterers that depend on them. Armita-X is disrupting the entire outdoor space heating industry by making use of our most current understanding of thermodynamics and modern computing to more efficiently generate heat- saving gas, money, and the environment. Our patented technology will be the first to bridge the gap between outdated mechanical devices and modern, intelligent, energy-conscience devices. Armita-X is a marvel in thermodynamic efficiency: Capturing waste in the form excess heat, the unit is able to generate its own electricity. Equipped with wireless networking, even multiple units are easy to control from the palm of your hand. Both the smartphone application and the touchscreen panel on the device provide information regarding the level of propane gas remaining, the duration until the propane gas cylinders need to be exchanged, battery levels, and temperature control options. In addition, the unit is smart enough to automatically power down when a leakage is detected. Ultimately, we envision Armita-X as a modular platform rather than a simple device. Based on needs addressed by customer discovery, we’ve already added the option to add lights, a touchscreen, and speakers, amongst others. Each Armita-X can be customized to match the particular needs of the end-user. A sleek aluminum casing encloses heating elements that better utilize propane gas, generating longer heating periods per unit of gas, and making use of the entire tank. Efficient design incorporates three different heat sources: while the first element helps generate heat quickly, the third element helps retain heat, striking a balance that allows for fast start-up and longer sustained heating periods. Using proximity sensors, Armita-X knows when to turn on and off, minimizing waste. Pressure sensors remove the guess-work of how much gas is left in the tanks, meaning you’ll no longer effectively throw your money away when disposing of tanks that still have leftover gas. our target market are residential( backyards) and commercial (restaurants,hotels, cafe's, bar's ,outdoor events and parties and etc).\",\n",

       "  'In today’s world, data is getting larger and complicated to analyze. Almost every company is gathering a lot of data and is looking for professionals who can analyze that data in order to make predictions & generate insights. Companies like Tencent are employing several thousands of data scientists who are using data and building machine learning models in order to generate predictions & make smarter decisions. Unfortunately, the demand for data scientist exceeds the supply. According to McKinsey research, there will be a shortage of 1.25 million data scientists by 2024. Quality data scientists are hard to find and expensive to employ as a single quality data scientist costs about $117,000 per year according to Glassdoor research. The data scientist has to then spend 45% of their time on model building that we believe is a very repetitive & time consuming process. On top of that, organizations that are thinking about building an in-house solution require more than 3.5 million RMB in investment & usually more than 6 months of development. That is why we’re building mltrons, which is predictive analytics in 5 clicks. We’re are enabling organizations to build and leverage advanced machine learning & deep learning algorithms without ever writing a single line of code or worrying about investing in infrastructure. The users just need to prepare the data and upload it into the application after which they need to tell the system what they want to predict. Then automatically, our AI engine builds the best fit model for their problems and provides them with real-time predictions and insights. Our AI engine is built on a robust architecture with state of the art algorithms. Our goal is to get companies from raw data to actionable predictions in the fastest way possible. Mltrons Ai engine can be connected to various data sources after which it loads the data, prepares and cleans the data, build hundreds of thousands of combinations of algorithms and then selects the best model for the problem that can be easily deployed in one click, either by using REST API, uploading new data or using our visual prediction. In essence, mltrons is simple yet scalable. But most importantly, mltrons is accurate & intelligent because as more data is fed it, it gets smarter.',\n",

       "  'Befect(Beyond limits of artificial intelligence with perfection) -The reason why \"Befect\" was born We consider life extension, human security-UNDP, and sustainable human development as the top priorities. In realizing these three values, human power alone is too big, too hard, and lacking to do many things, but I think all of this will be possible when artificial intelligence which has the same thoughts as us has replaces all of those things on our behalf. There are various thoughts in a person\\'s head, but everything can\\'t come up right away, and it\\'s very difficult to find what you want by combining the thoughts in your head. Therefore, when it is difficult to recall thoughts, people are indifferent or sad and pass by. If you can remember the thoughts you want in your head right away, your choice will become clearer, and if the memory is very special, you can combine new information to get another choice or better results. Through the process, you can clearly see what you want, and through this, you will be able to understand all the characteristics. We see all the people in the world who see, feel, and think as independent beings. Knowing all the characteristics of such independent people will provide the best satisfaction, and we will try to create new technologies or information by introducing and applying the characteristics to artificial intelligence. I think artificial intelligence can achieve great achievements in creating a better world of new information and products, rules, society, and culture in the future. -Befect is.. Understand the basic concepts and meanings that people think and understand the characteristics of the data perfectly. Define and understand data most quickly and accurately and learn on its own. It is the most advanced technology for machines to understand humans and the first artificial intelligence that machines themselves can grasp and understand information most quickly and completely. Traditional artificial intelligence has reached a breakthrough level of performance, often approaching and sometimes surpassing the capabilities of human experts. However, while we could identify the right information from the accumulated information, we couldn\\'t create a model with better new characteristics because of the limited information, so it was impossible to define it perfectly. As a result, it was not known what kind of thoughts and criteria the data created by artificial intelligence was created. No matter how good the results and performance are, it will leave a lot of risk and trial and error to use or graft to the level that humans want. This is because they deal with it in the same way as humans, but they do not have insights through deep thoughts and thoughts in thinking or dealing with problems. Befect fully understands the basic concept of data and has built a new characteristic model of the completed definition with characteristic data. We\\'re trying to define from the units of molecules to the stages of forming new consciousness Befect AI is the first artificial intelligence that can be defined on its own. A new idea that opens up a new future is about to begin. Befect will turn possibilities into reality. Befect can be such hope. However, human power cannot solve and achieve everything. Humans will be able to survive and thrive only when they solve all the problems that may arise inside and outside the Earth (space) through coexistence with machines. Artificial intelligence will be the most important last invention in human history with the potential to predict and determine the future of mankind. Our mission is to move toward an era of space pioneering and a new era starting with a new civilization while solving various problems facing mankind through artificial intelligence technology. Beyond the great leap of mankind, the construction of a new future for the eternal prosperity of mankind. Befect will be the first company to make artificial intelligence a reality. We will go beyond artificial intelligence and become a pioneer in the beginning of a new future drawn through artificial intelligence and the journey of the universe.',\n",

More features like multi-face detection and spoof detection are under development. Here’s a highlight of some of Biometric Vision’s best features so far: Anonymising images into an alphanumeric string (binary) that cannot be reversed engineered 99.99% accuracy in the most challenging scenarios Uses up to 180 landmarks to create a face template Blistering speed with a face match time of 130ms Algorithm uses less memory than our competitors for enrolment of a single image at 15MB, noting industry peak-memory benchmark median was 730MB and a top ranked with 33MB (NIST) AES 256+ encryption end-to-end',\n",

Four flexible screens are used, allowing each employee to be seen at a distance from anywhere on the table. KOH can be used by groups of 3 to 8 people on rectangular, square or round tables. In concrete terms, the solution connects to a Windows computer equipped with a Rooms solution. Thanks to an AI application and hardware acceleration, the 4 camera streams are mixed and optimized to get the best view of each face. The user experience is identical to a room with two screens. Except that your colleagues have super powers. They see you well, they are visible and the meeting can really work!

Each product uses facial and/or voice recognition to identify which employee is working at the time. This lets managers cross reference sales ability and customer satisfaction to specific employees.
