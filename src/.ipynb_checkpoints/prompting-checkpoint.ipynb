      "Pika is an AI-powered platform that allows users to create and edit films using captions and still images. The platform simplifies the video creation process by leveraging AI to generate dynamic visuals and sequences, making film production accessible to a wider audience.\n",
      "Result:\n",
      "Here are three examples of how Pika might be used, following the requested format:\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 1: A filmmaker uses Pika to create a quick storyboard for their short film, turning their initial script into a visual representation of the scenes, complete with dynamic camera angles and transitions. \n",
      "ONET JOB automated 1: Animators and Multimedia Artists that create storyboards to illustrate scenes or action sequences for films, television programs, or other media.\n",
      "ONET JOB 1: Animators and Multimedia Artists\n",
      "Confidence Interval 1: 8\n",
      "Reasoning 1: Pika's ability to translate script and text into visual scenes aligns with the tasks of storyboarding, a common practice in filmmaking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Example 2: A content creator uses Pika to edit a short video for social media, efficiently adding transitions, sound effects, and basic animations to their still images and captions, creating a polished final product. \n",
      "ONET JOB automated 2: Video Editors that edit raw video footage to produce a finished product by cutting, assembling, and splicing segments of video footage. \n",
      "ONET JOB 2: Video Editors\n",
      "Confidence Interval 2: 9\n",
      "Reasoning 2: Pika's core function revolves around generating video content from still images and text, aligning with the editing and manipulation of video content that video editors perform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Example 3: A storyteller uses Pika to quickly turn a series of photos from their travels into a short video with cinematic elements, adding music, transitions, and motion to create a compelling visual narrative. \n",
      "ONET JOB automated 3: Multimedia Artists that use graphic software to combine text, images, sound, video, and other media to create a variety of projects. \n",
      "ONET JOB 3: Multimedia Artists\n",
