      "Unfortunately, the description of Vaival Technologies LLC is very limited. We only know it's a SaaS company in Illinois. To accurately assess the likelihood of its product replacing human workforce activities, we need more information about: What specific problem does the software solve? Is it focused on a particular industry, or does it have broad applications? What are the key features and functionalities of the software? How does it automate tasks or processes? What kind of data does it use? Does it analyze data, generate reports, or automate decision-making? Without this information, it's impossible to provide a meaningful rating or identify a specific ONET job title. Example scenario to illustrate the need for more information: Let's say Vaival Technologies LLC develops software that automates customer service interactions using AI chatbots. This could potentially replace some tasks performed by customer service representatives (ONET code: 43-4061.00). However, if Vaival's software focuses on automating complex financial analyses, it might replace tasks performed by financial analysts (ONET code: 13-2051.00). To get a more accurate assessment, please provide more details about Vaival's product.\n",

Does it automate tasks, provide insights, or connect people? How does KoRrin use technology? Is AI involved? Is it a platform, software, or something else?
