We call it \"the event-based security model\".\nMost of the video surveillance software products currently available on the market operate in two categories: time of recording and source. This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras.\nFaceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers, family members, restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when, in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events. For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave. In the next two years we will make Faceter support protocols for several leading smart house platforms and standard callback APIs.\nWhen integrated with urban services, Faceter can be configured to perform specific actions, such as sending alerts to 911 if there are signs of violence or incipient crime.",

To achieve that goal, DataNovo has created the first AI- and machine learning-based system that offers three core features: (1) licensing; (2) AI-driven prior art searches; and (3) patent analytics. \n\nFor licensing, with a single key stroke, DataNovo's Software-as-a-Service platform allows any individual or corporate entity to identify potential infringers and associated infringing products to every U.S. patent, and helps patent owners advance monetization efforts and secure licensing opportunities. \n\nFor AI-driven prior art searches, with a single patent number (instead of keywords), DataNovo offers users the best prior art against that patent instantaneously. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, DataNovo aims to reduce search speed, improve result accuracy, and minimize cost.\n\nCompanies interested in patent landscape can also use DataNovo's patented platform to check if their new product may infringe on any existing patent.  \n\nFor patent analytics, which are suited for patent owners or business competitors who are looking to gather, analyze, and assess patent validity strength before pursuing or defending patent lawsuits, advancing licensing deals, or structuring M&A transactions, DataNovo's business intelligence helps facilitate real-world settlement, licensing, and purchase negotiations. \n\nWith DataNovo, companies are able to obtain stronger, more defensible patents, challenge frivolous lawsuits, assess critical licensing or infringing intelligence, and make informed business and strategic decisions throughout the companies'​ life cycles.",

    "FreshSurety’s Supply Chain Visibility and Event Management IaaS uses proprietary technology to convert any box, carton, or bag into a “Smart Container”, a self-contained chemistry laboratory.  Using this data, we apply five proprietary AI algorithms to reveal the current & future Net Present Value, NPV, of perishable foods, and natural/clean label ingredients inventory. Users can now optimize their inventory and reduce waste.\nProblem - Visually humans can’t determine the condition of perishable products and for Supply Chain managers decisions must be made on huge volumes of products at high velocity.  Without our technology perishables are shipped or stored with mismatched timing, the perishables quickly lose value, become unsellable and waste is the result.\n\nFreshSurety’s proprietary technology and algorithms answer three questions 1) What is the current value of my inventory? 2)   What is the Depreciation tomorrow and the day after? 3) Are there any problem events with my inventory? \n\nUnlike our competitors, which only guess what the inventory state is based on inferior mathematical models we measure certain targeted chemical actors to determine the actual freshness state of the product.  \nWe are the first to provide in real-time both the current and projected NPV of perishables inventory at either the order batch level or pallet level based on real data.   Supply Chain Managers get direct feedback on the current value of their inventory, not a “guess”.\n\nIn the home our products work inside of refrigerators, measuring stored foods remaining nutrition value so people can make better choices of when to best consume their foods based on its actual measured state. Also, our system alarms if Microbial Contamination is detected.\n\nValue Proposition: Making the products' Current Value and Rate of Depreciation visible, we literally take money from the trash and put it back in our customers' pockets. \nBusiness Model: Make Freshness Sensors cheap enough to give away and sell freshness IaaS NPV analysis.\nOur technology allows for automated real-time sampling of high-risk perishable stocks to a customer determined Acceptable Quality Level, AQL, at a 95% quality confidence level. Without FreshSurety technology only a very low confidence level <10%, (meaningless) quality inspection plans are possible. Because these plans have limited value, they are simply not performed, rendering the condition of stocks invisible and dangerous.\nOur technology has been demonstrated to successfully predict perishable freshness outcomes days in advance.  Competing solutions based on time & temperature technology are only right 16% of the time. FreshSurety's algorithms correctly label bad food as bad 99.3% of the time.    Our end-to-end system reduces food waste by over 1.5 tons per million dollars of retail value for Supply Chains over 5 days long and allows for automated real-time sampling of perishable stock at a 95% quality confidence level. We have gathered the world’s largest machine learning/AI training sets of perishable foods and have made many food freshness discoveries previously unknown to science.\n\nThe scientists and engineers of FreshSurety have over 120 years of combined technical and business experience working on programs for defense customers and DARPA.  We put our skills to work to create a new food freshness system that doesn’t require a degree in chemistry to use.  Working with food economists we built a new end-to-end system that reports the value of perishable foods, working in real-time, automatically, 24 X 7 X 365.",

By helping healthcare organizations apply advanced analytic capabilities to their data, Proskriptive enables better population care and more efficient management of healthcare resources. \r\n\r\n Proskriptive was founded to provide technology and services that will deliver the value that is expected from investments in analytic technologies but too infrequently delivered. While predictive technologies are becoming more accessible to non-data scientists the value of the analysis created by these tools still eludes most front line care providers and decision makers. This is due, in part, to the focus on the display of information while omitting the mechanisms necessary to extract value. \r\n\r\n Proskriptive is the marriage between the prospective and prescriptive analytic capabilities required to understand what happened and to identify both where opportunities will exist and what will need to be done in order to realize that value",
