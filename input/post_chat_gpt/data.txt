As the data format of machine learning, embeddings are critical to every AI application. But there are no existing tools that help developers use them.

Bobyard Logo
Bobyard
Construction is one of the largest industries in the world, but it is also one of the least technologically innovative spaces. Conducting fast and accurate cost estimates is a massive pain point because of the tedious nature of takeoffs (measuring & counting materials needed from the drawings). Bobyard automates the construction takeoff process with CV and NLP models to make cost estimates 10x faster while eliminating mistakes. We are a lean startup backed by some of the best VCs in the world: Primary and Pear. Almost all of the work lies ahead of us. We are excited to create next-gen software for the built world!

Meru Logo
Meru
Meru is out-of-the-box generative search that runs only where you want it to, with zero external data transfer. We're cloud-agnostic, compute-agnostic (CPU/GPU) and always compliant. With Meru you can deploy a full stack generative search product as a container on any infrastructure. Meru containers come preloaded with a custom base large language model, embeddings model, vector store, and an intelligent, custom-designed retrieval function. Meru can run on air gapped systems, which means your data is never sent over the internet, ever. Meru is not a 'third party'. It is a software package you download, deploy, and control in its entirety. This means you have full visibility into your data pipeline, and can remain compliant without negotiating any service agreements. Meru is fully extensible. You have the freedom to build custom ETL, analytics, and more around our containers to fully meet your needs. Meru saves you money. Instead of relying on strict volume-based pricing from third-party APIs, Meru allows you to control your costs by choosing which instances to deploy on (including CPU deployments) and scaling up and down according to demand. Meru is reliable. You launch Meru on your own infrastructure, which means no need to worry about rate limits, API downtime, and variable latency.

Relm
We believe that life itself is a journey to discover our place in the world. Put simply: to find our home. Relm is the only independent, free, and AI-guided real estate marketplace. Relm delivers buyers & sellers not only an alternative to the costly and outdated brokerage system, but a truly better option, finally empowering them to represent themselves and access the market directly. At the heart of Relm is Merlin, your personal AI guide, accompanying you throughout your home-buying or selling journey. For buyers, Merlin simplifies market navigation using conversational AI, helping you find your dream home based on anything you can imagine. For sellers, Merlin helps you understand your home’s value on a deeper level and list directly to the market using vision AI. Merlin supports you from start through close in Relm, providing all necessary resources in one place and guiding you through every step of the process. This includes connecting you directly with professionals across mortgage, insurance, title, and legal to ensure that Relm helps your dream seamlessly become reality. While the “Zil-tor-fin” big institutions continue to make 90% of their revenue by selling your personal data to the brokerage system, and other companies fight over specific segments of the existing transaction pipeline, Relm stands alone in creating a new system specifically designed to serve the overlooked community, the consumer.

Sobo Logo
Sobo
Sobo aims to help small and medium-sized business owners build more profitable companies. We do this by providing companies with a web-based dashboard and using their data to create AI-driven insights and engagement matches with a vetted consultant network. A problem worth solving: It is hard to understand the health of your business. Building and scaling a business isn’t easy; most business owners don’t know how to evaluate and benchmark their business comprehensively. It is hard to find and afford deep domain expertise. Even if business owners know where their business could perform better, it's hard to find and afford subject matter experts. Consulting is available, but it isn’t working for small and medium-sized businesses. Large consulting firms need to be within reach for small to mid-sized businesses. Good fractional advisors are hard to find and come with significant performance risk. The current online consulting marketplaces are a step forward, but don’t de-risk engaging a consultant. Our Solution Sobo integrates with a company’s existing cloud-based financial, HR, and CRM applications to build a data profile of the business. We use this data profile to populate a dashboard that provides key metrics and peer benchmarking for company management. This data is also available on an anonymous basis to our vetted network of consultants to perform a brief assessment and recommendation, which we term “Insights.” These Insights can be done proactively by the consultant at the company's request. Over time, these Insights will migrate to an AI predictive model. These Insights will prompt companies to request a consultant “match.” We will facilitate a successful consulting engagement through scoping, benchmarking, and assurance.

AIGC Chain Logo
AIGC Chain
AIGC Chain's solution is focusing on responsible AI by establishing a traceable AI system through its unique identity authentication and authorization processes for AI models on our smart contract. We have built over the past 2 and half years our own proprietary model of 100 billion parameters, ready to train and deploy Student Models (personalized assistants/chatbots/GPTs) at scale. By encoding the first few fields of the AI model into a unique binary ID, the identity of the model is established. The model authorization system, where a license is generated as a unique authentication ID, ensures that the AI model can only be used with the authorization of the owner. This authorization is linked to the owner's personal crypto address and the physical machine where the model is deployed (such as a GPU) through a smart contract. These processes ensure that the use and deployment of the AI models are transparent and traceable, promoting responsible AI development.

Altheia Inc Logo
Altheia Inc
The company / mission: Altheia is a health technology company specializing in unlocking data to truly put the patient first - in a way that prioritizes health equity and literacy in a scalable and affordable way. Introducing the Offering: The U.S. is a leader in technological advancements, but patient quality, outcomes and experience lag other countries, with the main reasons being data fragmentation, the amount of unstructured data in the system, and data ownership issues preventing data sharing. Complete patient health records has been the north star for many years, but technology and unclear economics have been blockers. Our offering is Acuvia, which leverages technological advancements to tackle this noble cause. First, we use AI enabled ingestion engines to read and store unstructured data, and combine it with structured for a complete patient view. Second, all data is patient consented – eliminating battles over data ownership and downstream uses of data. Our first focus area / use case for using the complete patient health record is Care Management. We layer on AI models and analytics to predict disease and prioritize outreach, while simultaneously engaging the patient in their own health and data uses. Because the collected data is patient owned, we are able to offer in-app incentives and shared data monetization plays (for example, in Life Sciences).

Octacore
Octacore is a revolutionary AI-driven Web3 Developer Toolkit, crucial for developing dApps with ease and preparing them for mass adoption. The magic behind Octacore lies in its core technology, which is built around two pivotal standards: ERC4337, known as **Account Abstraction**, and ERC6551, referred to as **Token Bound Accounts**. These standards are fundamental in providing individual wallets for any NFT and, consequently, making the web3 world ripe for reaching the masses. OctacoreAI takes a two-pronged approach: 1. OctaMind - AI Driven Development: It is chatbot for AI-driven development for Web3 using Octacore's APIs and SDKs. OctaMind is designed to handle Web3 specific queries and help developers understand web3 concepts, how to build web3 projects using Octacore including step-by-step guides, code snippets and help with any queries related to Octacore's products and services. Deploy Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DAOs, AI-Generated Suites, Build dApps, all from a chat. 2. Szabo - General Purpose Web3 Agent: The Szabo model helps users to navigate the complex world of Web3 with natural language with conversational user flows. This model fetches on-chain data and renders a button to execute transactions to fulfil all your Web 3 needs including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and so much more. Additionally, you can also integrate Szabo into your platform to give your users the power to converse to your platform and construct custom and complex transaction and that they can execute right during conversation, GASLESSLY. The core technology empowers three integral layers of Octacore: IDENTITY LAYER: Simplifies user onboarding to dApps with a PLUG-N-PLAY infrastructure, offering customized solutions like Social Login, Smart Login, and TBA Login. APPLICATION LAYER: Streamlines the development process by providing ready-to-deploy, audited Templates and Suites of Smart Contracts, and assists in managing roles, upgrades, and other smart contract interactions. DATA LAYER: Offers fast and reliable data through APIs, SDKs, and Webhooks, eliminating the need for node management and intricate blockchain development knowledge. Together, these layers, powered by Account Abstraction (ERC4337) and Token Bound Accounts (ERC6551), simplify building, deploying, and managing dApps, making them accessible and ready for widespread adoption.

Lexbox Logo
Lexbox
LexBox is an AI-driven, gamified online platform designed to support children with dyslexia by providing personalized learning experiences. Many children with dyslexia struggle with traditional learning methods, leading to frustration and poor academic performance. Parents, educators, and dyslexic students often lack access to comprehensive, personalized, and engaging resources to improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. LexBox offers an innovative solution by leveraging AI, machine learning, and gamification to create tailored learning experiences for dyslexic children. The platform also provides progress tracking, expert guidance, and a supportive online community for parents, guardians, and educators. We're developing an AI-driven, gamified online platform that helps children with a learning disorder (dyslexia) by providing personalized and engaging learning experiences. Our solution leverages AI, machine learning, and gamification techniques to create tailored lessons that target each child's specific needs, helping them improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. In addition to offering customized learning modules, LexBox provides progress tracking and expert guidance for parents, guardians, and educators. By helping to over 2 million children in the U.S. and 60 million worldwide, LexBox aims to empower dyslexic children to excel academically, boost their self-confidence, and build a brighter future. Our platform is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this multi-billion dollar market with a hybrid business model consisting of B2C subscriptions and B2B SaaS offerings. We learned from our experience that children with dyslexia struggle with traditional learning methods, leading to frustration and poor academic performance. Parents, educators, and dyslexic students often lack access to comprehensive, personalized, and engaging resources to improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. And most of the companies on the market use the Orton-Gillingham (OG) teaching method (developed in the 1930s). By incorporating the OG method into an AI/ML & gamified online platform, this technology can provide personalized learning plans and engaging activities that are tailored to each child's unique needs and abilities.

Prae
Like (FICO) credit scores are used to predict and monitor financial lending risk, Prae is developing the first parallel for Human Risk. Our praeCOG AI works by aggregating and correlating open source intelligence (OSINT) as well as government and commercial data sources to build a holistic, 360-degree “outside-in” radar chart. No intrusive endpoint tools or accesses to sensitive, internal HR systems/records. Our vision is to: Build trust by praeventing your digital tracks from causing harm. Prae is led by former US Intelligence operators specializing in offensive cyber, human intelligence (HUMINT), and cyber counterintelligence. Using this experience in intelligence operations and applied in private industry, Prae takes a different approach to Human Risk by blending data science and OSINT and then applying human psychology models of human motivations, vulnerabilities, and stressors. Prae then applies this “targeting model” so everyone can be digitally aware.

doFlo Logo
doFlo
doFlo is a new way of doing workflow automation. Market leaders, despite their dominance, are now experiencing unprecedented churn and this is because they’ve failed to meet the evolving expectations of their user base. As long term automation users ourselves, we've faced the same issues; high-friction setups, temperamental workflows, and being limited to simple, partial processes. Essentially, it boils down to; usability, reliability, and scalability. The proof is in the data. According to PWC, 69% of automation initiatives fail to execute due to complexity, and of those that do, another 50% then fail later on due to reliability and scalability issues. Clearly there’s an industry-wide problem here. doFlo, powered by asynchronous event streaming technology and AI, addresses these gaps and is so compelling that we’re seeing, not churned, but existing automation users move to doFlo. So what does it look like? Our workflow editor is drag and drop, it’s no code and uses simple annotations in English to create automations for you. It’s easy, if you can plot a flow chart, you can make sophisticated workflows that never fail, in minutes. We plan to maneuver from SMB to mid-market and enterprise, but first we must segment. Our ICP is the unaddressed real estate market, sold via self-service for bottom-up scaling. After monopolizing this, we'll then expand horizontally into more competitive markets. Our competitors serve basic process needs for SMB customers quite well, but their mid-market and enterprise customers seek more scalable and sophisticated workflows. doFlo’s limitless scalability means we meet these expectations perfectly. Our business model is simple. It’s to offer a superior, affordable product for our customers with higher margins for us and our pricing model scales on automation connections and storage capacity. This isn’t the first time I’ve done this. In fact, the doFlo founders have seen repeated success. Across our 12 years together, we’ve founded a number of successful companies, which includes a notable exit to Avast in 2018. doFlo is making good progress so far. We recently hit $5K MRR from our paid pilot program that we opened in December, have 100 accounts on our waiting list, and plan for GA in March 2024.

Arnaque
Our Mission: To use generative AI to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of medical record information. The Problem: Medical records are often inaccurate, incomplete, and difficult to access for both doctors and patients. This can lead to errors in diagnosis and treatment, and can also make it difficult for patients to manage their own care. Our Solution: Arnaque is developing a platform that uses AI to help doctors and patients record medical record information more accurately, efficiently, and accessibly. The platform will use natural language processing to understand the context of medical conversations, and will then generate structured data that can be easily stored and retrieved.

Locusive Logo
Locusive
Hey there, welcome to Locusive. If you've ever navigated the maze of a SaaS tool and wished for a quicker way to find answers, or if you're a CSM feeling the weight of endless queries, we see you. We've been there too. We've seen time and again how important it is to service customers quickly, effectively, and accurately. Most businesses struggle to get customers everything they want and need when they ask for it. CSMs spin their wheels with data pulls, engineers that should be working on product have to come up with quick queries, and there's no time to service the long-tail of smaller customers that are all trying to gain value from your business or product. That's where the idea for Locusive was born. Our goal is to create an AI assistant that feels like a guide or concierge for your business. For users, it's about streamlining those moments of "how do I...?" and turning them into "oh, that's how!". And for the CSMs, it's about filtering out the noise, letting you focus on the deeper, more strategic aspects of your role. We're on a journey to blend technology with a bit of that human touch, making the digital space feel a tad more navigable and friendly. Interested in the evolving landscape of customer success and AI's role in it? Check us out at locusive.com.

Today, knowing who your customers are is one of the biggest problems facing offline businesses. Small and medium businesses with physical storefronts often struggle to identify their customers and manage their own technology stacks in order to piece together disconnected pieces of information. The process of customer identification should be transparent and simple for shoppers as one click, allowing businesses to combine all data silos into one tool that can bring together transaction information and customer data. Major point-of-sale (POS) providers are investing millions of dollars in improving their credit card processing part of the business, but there is little focus on customer identification and getting those customers to come back and shop more, increasing their average ticket value. We have taken on the difficult task of building the first platform that takes over the core customer identification experience. We connect all data from online and offline customer touchpoints into one single tool, allowing businesses to not only accurately identify their best customers, but also understand their purchase preferences and habits in order to embrace the entire customer experience and convert first-time shoppers into loyal fans, increase customer lifetime value, and drive more revenue for the business. It's simple: understand who your most valuable customers are, reward them, sell more. Repeat.

To achieve enduring information dominance, they utilize AI-powered model-based systems engineering (MBSE) along with multiparadigm data science methods for the real-time detection and deployment of AI-tailored decoys.

Koya AI Logo
Koya AI
Koya AI helps data aggregators such as marketplaces and procurement platforms to manage catalog data seamlessly. Instead of spending days manually chasing down, standardizing, and enriching product data, marketplaces can rely on Koya’s data-as-a-service offering. Bad data is the next frontier in ecommerce. Crucial services such as search and discovery, bringing new products live, and recommendations depend on product data quality. This data varies widely across providers and changes frequently, creating tremendous complexity. Today, most marketplaces and data aggregators manage these workflows manually, which is slow, inaccurate, and cumbersome. Seller listings are delayed, users have a poor on-site experience, and the marketplace sees lower conversion rates. Koya helps our clients obtain, normalize, and continually update product data with the power of Machine Learning.

HyprWin Logo
HyprWin
Revolutionizing Sales with AI to Streamline Onboarding and Eliminate Non-Essential Tasks In the ever-evolving world of business, one thing remains constant: the challenges associated with the sales process. From lack of a clear value proposition, lack of an understanding of your product from a value-based approach, to not knowing what problems you’re trying to solve and how that relates to your prospect. The lack of asking your prospect good open-ended questions to find the gap, of what problems they face and how your product can help fill that gap, to unstructured onboarding and guidance, to the overwhelming amount of busy work that often doesn’t contribute to closing deals, we’ve seen sales reps, founders, and leaders struggle. At the same time, the tech industry is witnessing significant layoffs, with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta, and Zoom considerably reducing their workforces. This industry shift has caused a surge of talented tech professionals to venture into entrepreneurship, launch their own firms, or join smaller tech firms that present substantial growth opportunities. Moreover, we’re experiencing a groundbreaking era characterized by the emergence of Generative AI, heralding an exciting new wave of technology. This transformation in the tech landscape introduces compelling advancements and opportunities. In this dynamic context, we see a unique opportunity to assist these emergent ventures and tech firms grappling with articulating their unique value propositions. That’s where HyprWin comes into play. Our next-generation sales enablement platform, powered by advanced AI, is primed to meet the needs of this rapidly evolving landscape. It leverages this new wave of technology and taps into the immense pool of talent looking to make a mark. HyprWin’s primary objective is to optimize the sales process, from prospect identification to deal closure. We leverage AI technology to create a dynamic, swift, and focused workflow that guides you efficiently in the right direction. Our focus is not to replicate CRM systems, laden with unnecessary complexities where only a small fraction of the features are truly useful. We adopt a CRM-agnostic approach and offer API connectivity, allowing you to integrate our platform with your existing CRM solution seamlessly if you choose to do so. Our roots are in the realm of microservices and laser-focused sales processes. With HyprWin, we’ve streamlined the approach, enabling startups to efficiently market their unique value propositions and maintain that crucial focus to facilitate rapid sales. We stand as a resource for individual contributors and teams eager to accelerate their processes and articulate their value in the most effective manner possible. Here’s how HyprWin addresses the common challenges and can be particularly beneficial to startups and smaller tech firms in the current climate. Structured Onboarding: In the wake of tech layoffs expanding the talent pool, startups and smaller tech firms are ideally positioned to harness the skills of these high-caliber professionals. With HyprWin’s AI-Driven Workflow, we eliminate the prolonged and complex onboarding processes, allowing you to swiftly integrate these professionals into your sales process. Our platform serves as a comprehensive workflow, designed to guide anyone looking to sell their SaaS product from prospect to close. This means that new representatives, irrespective of their experience level, can hit the ground running with HyprWin, armed with the necessary insights and tools to excel. Guidance: Our platform provides continuous guidance throughout the sales cycle. From prospecting to closing deals, HyprWin’s AI guides reps every step of the way, ensuring they never feel lost or unsure of their next move, which is particularly crucial for startups that need to move quickly and efficiently. Eliminating Busy Work: With the rise of “revenge startups” by those affected by layoffs, there’s a need to focus on what matters most - building a quality product and closing deals. HyprWin automates various time-consuming tasks, freeing up sales reps to focus on these key aspects. From updating customer records to ranking lead quality, HyprWin handles the tedious tasks so your reps can focus on building relationships and closing sales. Reducing Non-Closing Activities: HyprWin streamlines the sales process by focusing on activities that directly contribute to deal closure. Our platform promotes clear communication and goal alignment with prospects, ensuring that reps spend their time on high-impact tasks that lead to sales. With HyprWin, sales reps are empowered to focus on what they do best: selling. Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with an intuitive user experience, revolutionizing the way sales teams operate and helping startups and teams to navigate the current landscape of the tech industry. With the ongoing economic disruption and the surge of startups, the current market conditions create an ideal environment for new businesses to emerge. A recent survey of 1,000 laid-off tech workers conducted by Clarify Capital LLC found that 63% of the respondents started their own company after their layoff. As these new startups rise from the ashes of tech industry layoffs, HyprWin stands ready to support these bold entrepreneurs and smaller techfirms in accelerating their sales and driving their success. In the end, we believe that the key to overcoming the challenges in the sales process lies in intelligent automation, actionable insights, and effective guidance. With HyprWin, we’re making that belief a reality, one sales team at a time. HyprWin is more than just a tool - it’s a game changer for those in the sales industry. Whether you’re an individual sales rep looking to streamline your process and sell value in the best way possible, or a startup aiming to sell your unique value proposition quickly and efficiently, HyprWin is designed to support you. We are committed to helping teams and startups navigate the changing landscape of the tech industry, turning challenges into opportunities and driving success. With HyprWin, you’re not just getting a platform - you’re getting a partner in success. Together, we can redefine what’s possible in sales.

Dune Security Logo
Dune Security
AI fighting AI. CISOs face an impossible risk landscape today. 80% of cybersecurity breaches start because of employee error. The problem is exacerbating with generative AI, as a single hacker can specifically target thousands of employees in the same amount of time that they used to specifically target tens of employees with social engineering. CISOs lack tools to deal with employee risk and are held accountable when a breach inevitably happens. By leveraging AI at each step, Dune Security empowers organizations to quantify individual risk through analyzing user behavior, context, learning patterns, and third party data. This allows the automation of tailored cybersecurity measures to each individual, transforming vulnerabilities into strengths. Dune is the central engine of all employee risk data, which is a solution that is not just timely for organizations but necessary in navigating the present cybersecurity landscape. This gives the CISO the capability to understand who are the high risk employees, to what extent, and why - as well as automatically remediate and restrict access to keep their organization safe. Today, Dune Security uniquely replaces legacy and ineffective security awareness training by pinpointing the crucial 8% of employees responsible for 80% of the risk, ensuring all employees receive personalized, machine learning-driven training tailored to their risk profile. CISOs also have easy access to quantifiable data via robust reporting and API-out capability, enabling them to both report to compliance auditors, regulators, and insurance underwriters, as well as restrict access to high-risk employees through other security systems.

Panza AI Logo
Panza AI
Panza's AI platform uses custom trained, supervised LLMs to help financial institutions proactively mitigate balance sheet risk and product compliance exposure. Risk and compliance management is human capital intensive, and speed is more important than ever. Banks spend up to 6-10% of their revenue on risk and compliance functions, but still struggle to keep up, with $548B lost to insolvent banks in 2023, and regulators assessing billions of dollars in fines each year. According to the American Banker Association, 59% of U.S. banks surveyed say they are very concerned about their ability to manage risk across all lines of business, and a similar percentage were very concerned about maintaining compliance with changing regulations. Panza simplifies and enhances risk and compliance management with a specialized AI continuously monitoring and evaluating risks across regional and global market data, bank portfolios, news, social media, regulatory releases, and bank products. For less than the cost of an FTE, with Panza financial institutions can reduce balance sheet risks, automatically enforce regulatory compliance in their products, and transform risk analysis and mitigation workflows through a chat interface.

agenci3 Logo
agenci3
"agenci3 indeed sounds unique and fills a specific niche in the market. Local and state political candidates often lack the resources and support that national-level candidates have, so a service like this could be very beneficial for them. Simulating interviews and debates is a particularly innovative use of AI." - OpenAI to Jeff Bodzewski 07.07.2023 Agenci3 is more than the first generative AI campaign advisor to craft compelling content, and simulate interviews with actual media and debate opponents. We are the competitive advantage to help the typically underfunded and understaffed 560,000+ local and state candidates win elections. Our ChatGPT-4 powered LLM has been exhaustively trained and refined by senior advisers with backgrounds in public affairs to generate personalized content that resonates with voters and moves them to action. Each piece of content used to train our models is reviewed by our team to ensure the source is credible, factual and with a strong bias for writings, transcripts and other publicly available content. agenci3 never uses automated processes to scrape web for content so we can ensure the integrity of our model. A recent academic paper by experts from Oxford, Cambridge and other universities found "that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models.” agenci3 is deliberately built to deliver long-term value to its customers and investors alike. Our subscription service beginning at $99/month is affordable, easy to use and accessible from anywhere. But most importantly, it's effective.

This includes problem solving or troubleshooting with greatest impact on tech forums like stackoverflow.com used to see 100 million visitors a month. Combine this with the changing work culture where freelancing is on the rise, and current freelancer platforms are too slow to adapt to a changing world.

Everything about ezSIXTY is about the rapid pace of a post chatGPT world.

DRONEQUBE is an innovative agri-tech startup that specializes in autonomous drone technology for precision agriculture, with a focus on viticulture. Leveraging advanced data analytics, AI-driven anomaly detection, and precision spraying techniques, DRONEQUBE aims to address critical challenges faced by the wine-growing industry. These challenges include the impacts of global warming on vineyard yields, the rising costs associated with an aging agricultural workforce, and the increasing residues on food from traditional farming practices. The company's technology suite includes a state-of-the-art AgriData Archive for climate-adaptive viticulture, which records and integrates vegetation indices, thermal data, and weather sensor information to provide comprehensive vineyard insights. DRONEQUBE's 3D Virtual Vineyard platform utilizes drone data to create detailed vineyard maps for virtual inspections, enabling early problem detection and targeted interventions. Their flagship offering, the Smart Spray & Autonomous Refill System, embodies precision agriculture by autonomously applying and tracking agrochemicals with minimal waste, thus optimizing resource usage and improving crop yields. DRONEQUBE’s technology promises a significant reduction in agrochemical and water consumption, with a consequent increase in yield, aligning with sustainability goals and the need for high-efficiency agricultural practices. The potential of DRONEQUBE's solutions to revolutionize viticulture is underscored by their robust financial model, which anticipates substantial savings for the industry through reduced labor costs and increased efficiency. The startup’s alignment with key sustainability goals such as climate action, zero hunger, and industry innovation further positions it as a forward-thinking player in the agri-tech space.

Fownd Inc. Logo
Fownd Inc.
FOWND is a company that aims to ease the administrative workload for physical therapists during sessions. To achieve this, we plan to use AI/ML technologies to provide computer vision-aided goniometric and functional assessments that are customized for physical therapy. Our approach will also include natural language processing to transcribe session notes and generate standardized complaint reports using a custom AI model. Additionally, we are developing large language models that will assist physical therapists in notetaking and monitoring patient progress more effectively. For example, we are training AI to help with exercise lookups and create tailored therapy plans, accurately attribute billable codes to session documents, and offer custom clinic services for remote monitoring of therapy aided by generative AI.

Differently from traditional devops tools that rely on humans to do the heavy lifting of curating a list of dependencies, ogre.run has AI at its core, decreasing "dependency hunting" from hours to minutes. ogre.run relies on the combination of graph analysis and large language models (LLMs). The latter are fine-tuned by our AI team to master the understanding of the software dependency graph from an input source code.

Nurdle AI Logo
Nurdle AI
87% of AI projects never make it to production. Whether it’s because they are inaccurate, hallucinate, don’t work in real-world contexts, misunderstand real people or that they’re stuck before they start because of the “cold-start problem”, the issue comes down to not enough high-quality use-case specific, privacy-compliant labeled data for training. But real-world human-labeled data is expensive and requires a lot of data science labor – and synthetic data is so low-quality and unrelated to the model’s actual use-case that it doesn’t improve performance much. Nurdle can help. By using real-world human-labeled kernel datasets built for specific use-cases, we produce enhanced synthetic datasets that perform almost as well as human-labeled at the speed and price of synthetic datasets. Contact us for a free data gap analysis showing you what kind of data you’re missing and how much you need for your performance target. Nurdle AI uses real-world custom use case datasets to generate synthetic datasets for accurate LLMs.

Ivyngton Logo
Ivyngton
Ivyngton means personalized insurance, just for you. The insurance maze has left many feeling lost, unheard, and undervalued. That's why Ivyngton is here to chart a new course. Ivyngton transforms the insurance landscape with an innovative AI-enabled approach. Personalizing each policy: Everyone is unique, with distinct needs and concerns. At Ivyngton, we believe your insurance should reflect just that. Instead of providing a generic policy, our advanced 63B parameter insurance quote model is designed to understand and cater to your specific requirements. This not only ensures that you're covered for what truly matters to you but also provides us with precise insights into the risk profiles of the policies we craft for each individual. Assured insurance: We are the only insurance company which will pay your claim even if the underwriter refuses to. If your claim isn't paid by our underwriters, we step in. Our legal team fights for all unpaid claims, no matter how small, and we charge only 20% of the recovered amount. Lower risk: Instead of confusing terms and hidden fees like traditional insurance companies, we only take 30% of premiums as profit and give the remaining 70% to our underwriters. In return, these underwriters shoulder 100% of the risk. AI-categorized policies: By harnessing the power of our models, we offer underwriters precise risk categorization for millions of personalized policies. This means faster approvals, fewer denials, and more accurate pricing for customers. Transparent, accessible, and efficient: Our customer dashboard is an instant one-stop-shop for all of your policies, whether taken out by you or your employer, saving you time and stress, allowing you easy one-click claims and one-click access of all of your documents. Experience the difference of having assurance beyond insurance. Say Goodbye to nightmare experiences and Hello to an ally in your corner.

Context Data Logo
Context Data
Context Data is an enterprise data infrastructure built to accelerate the development of data pipelines for Generative AI applications. The platform automates the process of setting up internal data processing and transformation flows using an easy-to-use connectivity framework where developers and enterprises can quickly connect to all of their internal data sources, embedding models and vector database targets without having to set up expensive infrastructure or engineers. The platform also allows developers to schedule recurring data flows for refreshed and up-to-date data. For developers and companies building Generative AI applications, one of their biggest challenges is building and maintaining scalable data infrastructure for creating contextual data which will power their AI applications. Think about the efficient movement of data from their various sources (MySQL, Salesforce, Amazon S3) as well as transformations (joins, aggregations etc.) to the final vector databases. Context Data allows them to quickly achieve this without having to write any code. Imagine creating a scheduled process that extracts financial and legal information from your pdf documents and writes it to your Pinecone vector database within 10 minutes. Context Data is able to create this end-to-end process in as little as 10 minutes without having to create expensive infrastructure and writing hours of complicated code.

Triorama AI
At Triorama, we are reshaping how industries engage with digital environments through pioneering AI and 3D technology. Our platform, backed by a robust custom 3D engine, offers leading-edge 3D configurators that enhance interactivity and user engagement. Our upcoming AI-powered AR room designer promises to revolutionize the way spaces are designed and experienced, providing tools that are not only innovative but also intuitive. Basically, we started this because, during our early consulting days, we encountered eCommerce companies striving to differentiate themselves in a competitive market. They shared a common challenge: the need to enhance the online shopping experience, better decision-making on purchases, and reduce product returns. Our 3D configurators became a game-changer, offering customers a way to interact with products like never before. This interactivity allowed for personal customization and significantly improved their decision-making process, leading to a noticeable decrease in returns and heightened customer satisfaction. Join us on this journey at Triorama as we continue to innovate and provide solutions that not only meet the current market demands but also anticipate future needs.

visualAI retail solutions, Inc. Logo
visualAI retail solutions, Inc.
visualAI, a cutting-edge SaaS company, empowers e-commerce businesses with AI-driven solutions that revolutionize product discovery, enhance user engagement, and boost revenue. Our flagship product, shopperGPT, is a game-changing multimodal conversational shopping agent. Here’s how it works: Hyper-Personalized Shopping Experience: shopperGPT seamlessly integrates into e-commerce platforms, offering shoppers a personalized journey. Users can search for products using natural language, find products based on any specific color, or even submit images to find visually similar matches. Retrieval Augmented Generation & Fine-Tuned LLMs: Our technology combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with client-specific data. By augmenting and fine-tuning LLM responses, we ensure accurate and context-aware search results. Additionally, we employ data augmentation techniques to further optimize accuracy. Platform Expansion: Initially available directly, shopperGPT will soon integrate with popular e-commerce platforms like Magento, BigCommerce, Salesforce, and Shopify. Our mission? To fundamentally transform how shoppers discover products online, starting with the fashion vertical. Why VisualAI Matters for Retailers: Engagement Boost: Visual search can increase session durations by up to 30%, while click-through rates improve by approximately 15-25%. Shoppers stay longer and interact more, enhancing overall engagement. Hyper-personalization is shown to dramatically improve user engagement, time on the site and purchases. Accelerated Discovery: Visual search reduces the user journey time by nearly 50%. In sectors like fashion and home décor, this efficiency translates to a 10-15% increase in customer satisfaction ratings. Revenue Uplift: Implementing visual search leads to a 20-30% rise in conversion rates. Simplified discovery processes and impulse purchases contribute to an average order value increase of 10-20%. Moreover, the data collected via visual search refines recommendation algorithms, potentially boosting upsell and cross-sell rates by up to 25% visualAI isn’t just a technological advancement; it’s a strategic business move that elevates user experience, streamlines product discovery, and positively impacts the bottom line.

DocuSeer Logo
DocuSeer
We want to revolutionize and simplify the way employees access a Company’s internal information. Historically when you have a question you could either: 1. Ask a coworker, which is a waste of time and you may not get an immediate answer or, 2. Search the intranet for the answer; intranets are overwhelming and also a waste of time to search for the right document then look in the document for the answer to your question. The solution is DocuSeer, an AI powered messenger app bot that talks to all your internal policies and can provide immediate answers and send the policy document that the answer came from using your messenger app (i.e. Slack). We’re committed to making our product: 1. Easy to use - no training is needed as it integrates seamlessly with your messenger app that all employees are already using 2. Highly accurate answers to internal questions 3. Easy to implement, less than 10 hours of your time, yet tailored to your Company’s specific needs

SmartPAR Logo
SmartPAR
Empowering Healthcare with AI-Driven Inventory Management At SmartPAR, our journey began with a clear and ambitious goal: to revolutionize hospital inventory management using the power of artificial intelligence. We envisioned a system that not only streamlines inventory processes but also provides healthcare institutions with unprecedented access to critical data, enabling better decision-making and enhancing patient care. The concept of SmartPAR transformed from an idea into reality in late 2023. Supported by venture funding, we have brought together a team of experts, boasting a collective experience of over a thousand years, dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in healthcare technology. “Advancing healthcare through adaptable and innovative inventory management solutions.” Smart Sync Imagine your current inventory and supply chain management tools evolving to work seamlessly in your favor. Our innovative system is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing infrastructure, enhancing operations with a user-centered approach. Leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI), we revolutionize product identification by capturing global product icons directly from packaging. This flexibility allows us to position scanners at strategic points preferred by your team, optimizing workflow efficiency. The immediate synchronization of this data with your inventory and supply chain software ensures real-time accuracy and operational excellence. Universal Product Catalog Hospitals nationwide are burdened with the time-consuming task of manually entering products into their inventory systems. Recognizing this challenge, we've harnessed data directly from the FDA's 510(k) Premarket Notification database, alongside exclusive partnerships with leading Medical Device Companies. This collaboration has empowered us to develop a comprehensive, universal product catalog. Our catalog is meticulously maintained and updated daily, ensuring that your inventory management and supply chain software are always current with the latest product information. This innovative solution not only streamlines the inventory process but also grants immediate access to essential updates, significantly reducing manual data entry and enhancing operational efficiency. Data Insights Introducing our Artificial Intelligence and Learned Language Data Reporting System: a revolutionary tool designed to empower your hospital team with instant access to critical data and reports. Is your team currently facing delays in accessing the information they need? Are you reliant on an IT department that takes weeks to respond to requests? Our solution transforms these challenges into a thing of the past. With our system, you gain the ability to request any report or dashboard directly from your existing systems - effortlessly and instantly. Once integrated, our advanced learned language model allows users to interact with the system using simple prompts. This means you can ask for the specific report you need, when you need it, without any technical expertise or waiting period. Streamline your data access, enhance decision-making, and elevate patient care with our AI-driven reporting system.

Aidelly Logo
Aidelly
Aidelly, an Atlanta-based SaaS company announces the launch of a virtual “AI -Marketing Director” for hire. The AI assistant learns your brand from your website content, public web search results including social media platforms and customizes your outbound marketing campaigns with your brand imagery and voice - all for a monthly subscription fee. Now business owners, marketing officers, non-profits and marketing agencies can leverage the efficiencies of AI without sacrificing the consistency of their brand. As information overload occurs, businesses rely on the “look and feel” and voice of their brand to help customers recognize their business and trust them among a crowd of competitors. This brand trust is a valuable asset that increases engagement and converts into sales. Aidelly enables you to take advantage of AI while also unifying your specific, brand image and company voice across all communication channels. This consistency of branding used on a regular basis creates credibility for your company. A force multiplier effect occurs as Aidelly tools help you amplify your marketing efforts to produce more output while simultaneously building brand recognition. Aidelly is the first advanced prompting service that empowers marketers to save time with content generation while still maintaining brand engagement. “Marketers want to maintain the authenticity of their brand and to access AI without the need to develop personal AI expertise, commented Wilzer Jean- Baptiste, CEO, of Aidelly. “We solve that problem for companies by automatically customizing content for them with brand elements.” Aidelly’s AI saves significant amounts of time and effort and provides access to advanced AI capabilities without investing into a learning curve. A convenient dashboard offers multiple tools to amplify marketing efforts to gain more visibility online and produce more customer engagement. The subscription-based service makes it feasible for small to mid-sized businesses to control costs while gaining the advantages of marketing with AI and developing brand recognition at the same time.

Vinebotics
Vinebotics, where the fusion of technology and tradition is reshaping the future of viticulture. Nestled in the picturesque landscapes of Napa Valley, Vinebotics is a forward-thinking startup dedicated to advancing vineyard management through the innovative use of clean energy electric land and air robotics. Our journey is rooted in a passion for winemaking, a reverence for nature, and a commitment to sustainability. Innovating for a Sustainable Future At Vinebotics, we believe that the key to unlocking the full potential of vineyards lies in harnessing the power of cutting-edge technology, while maintaining an unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship. Our fleet of autonomous vehicles, powered by renewable energy, represents the vanguard of agricultural innovation. Equipped with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and UV-C lighting, our robots are designed to meticulously care for vines, ensuring they are free from harmful pathogens such as mold, fungus, pests, and bacteria. Clean Energy Robotics: The Heart of Vinebotics Our technology stands at the intersection of efficiency and eco-friendliness. By integrating clean electric energy into our land and air robotics, we are not only minimizing our carbon footprint but also revolutionizing the way vineyard tasks are performed. From precision soil analysis to the targeted application of UV-C light for sterilization, Vinebotics' solutions offer a comprehensive approach to vineyard management that prioritizes the health of the crop and the planet. AI and UV-C Lighting: A Duo for Superior Viticulture The application of AI allows Vinebotics to redefine precision in vineyard management. Our intelligent systems analyze vast amounts of data to make informed decisions, optimizing the health and productivity of each vine. Meanwhile, UV-C lighting provides a powerful, chemical-free method of sterilization, aligning with the growing demand for organic and sustainably produced wines. Together, these technologies ensure that vineyards can achieve higher yields of superior quality grapes, without compromising on environmental values. Embracing the Vinebotics Advantage Choosing Vinebotics means embracing a future where technology and tradition coalesce to create unparalleled value for vineyards. The benefits of our approach include: Enhanced Efficiency: Automated solutions that reduce labor costs and streamline vineyard operations. Improved Crop Health: AI-driven insights and UV-C sterilization boost crop resilience and yield. Sustainability: Clean energy and reduced chemical use contribute to a healthier ecosystem. Organic Compatibility: Our methods support vineyards in achieving and maintaining organic certification. Join the Revolution in Vineyard Management Vinebotics is more than just a startup; we are a community of innovators, environmentalists, and wine enthusiasts united by a common goal: to revolutionize vineyard management in a way that respects the earth and enhances the art of winemaking. From the fertile soils of Napa Valley, we invite vineyard owners, technology pioneers, and sustainability advocates to join us in cultivating a future where technology nurtures nature, and winemaking traditions flourish for generations to come.

AI Compliance Logo
AI Compliance
Many potential users of AI are held back by the worry that their project may not be compliant with current or future regulations. This can apply if you use AI in any part of your organization. In the worst case you may have to abandon your AI project, or face fines or other penalties. Use our audit tool to understand issues that may affect your plans. You can purchase a digital audit, which uses Dynamic Knowledge Graph technology, to ask a series of questions to establish current and future compliance considerations for your application in a single jurisdiction. Currently we support the USA, the EU and the UK as jurisdictions. We are working on adding more. Unlike Generative AI-based technology, the Knowledge Graph operation is transparent, traceable and repeatable, and thus we can ensure the reliability of the results and rapidly adapt to changes in compliance and AI technology. The results of the audit will be presented on screen and as a downloadable PDF link.
