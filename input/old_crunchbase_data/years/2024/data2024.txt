Empowering Healthcare with AI-Driven Inventory Management At SmartPAR, our journey began with a clear and ambitious goal: to revolutionize hospital inventory management using the power of artificial intelligence. We envisioned a system that not only streamlines inventory processes but also provides healthcare institutions with unprecedented access to critical data, enabling better decision-making and enhancing patient care. The concept of SmartPAR transformed from an idea into reality in late 2023. Supported by venture funding, we have brought together a team of experts, boasting a collective experience of over a thousand years, dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in healthcare technology. “Advancing healthcare through adaptable and innovative inventory management solutions.” Smart Sync Imagine your current inventory and supply chain management tools evolving to work seamlessly in your favor.

This flexibility allows us to position scanners at strategic points preferred by your team, optimizing workflow efficiency. The immediate synchronization of this data with your inventory and supply chain software ensures real-time accuracy and operational excellence. Universal Product Catalog Hospitals nationwide are burdened with the time-consuming task of manually entering products into their inventory systems. Recognizing this challenge, we've harnessed data directly from the FDA's 510(k) Premarket Notification database, alongside exclusive partnerships with leading Medical Device Companies. This collaboration has empowered us to develop a comprehensive, universal product catalog. Our catalog is meticulously maintained and updated daily, ensuring that your inventory management and supply chain software are always current with the latest product information. This innovative solution not only streamlines the inventory process but also grants immediate access to essential updates, significantly reducing manual data entry and enhancing operational efficiency. Data Insights Introducing our Artificial Intelligence and Learned Language Data Reporting System: a revolutionary tool designed to empower your hospital team with instant access to critical data and reports. Is your team currently facing delays in accessing the information they need? Are you reliant on an IT department that takes weeks to respond to requests? Our solution transforms these challenges into a thing of the past. With our system, you gain the ability to request any report or dashboard directly from your existing systems - effortlessly and instantly. Once integrated, our advanced learned language model allows users to interact with the system using simple prompts. This means you can ask for the specific report you need, when you need it, without any technical expertise or waiting period.

Jan 1, 2024
Aidelly, an Atlanta-based SaaS company announces the launch of a virtual “AI -Marketing Director” for hire. The AI assistant learns your brand from your website content, public web search results including social media platforms and customizes your outbound marketing campaigns with your brand imagery and voice - all for a monthly subscription fee. Now business owners, marketing officers, non-profits and marketing agencies can leverage the efficiencies of AI without sacrificing the consistency of their brand. As information overload occurs, businesses rely on the “look and feel” and voice of their brand to help customers recognize their business and trust them among a crowd of competitors. This brand trust is a valuable asset that increases engagement and converts into sales. Aidelly enables you to take advantage of AI while also unifying your specific, brand image and company voice across all communication channels. This consistency of branding used on a regular basis creates credibility for your company. A force multiplier effect occurs as Aidelly tools help you amplify your marketing efforts to produce more output while simultaneously building brand recognition. Aidelly is the first advanced prompting service that empowers marketers to save time with content generation while still maintaining brand engagement. “Marketers want to maintain the authenticity of their brand and to access AI without the need to develop personal AI expertise, commented Wilzer Jean- Baptiste, CEO, of Aidelly. “We solve that problem for companies by automatically customizing content for them with brand elements.” Aidelly’s AI saves significant amounts of time and effort and provides access to advanced AI capabilities without investing into a learning curve. A convenient dashboard offers multiple tools to amplify marketing efforts to gain more visibility online and produce more customer engagement. The subscription-based service makes it feasible for small to mid-sized businesses to control costs while gaining the advantages of marketing with AI and developing brand recognition at the same time.

As the founders of AIDA, we embarked on this journey with a profound vision to revolutionize children's digital engagement, guided by a mission to provide a mindful and balanced platform that nurtures young minds. Our core objective at AIDA is to blend the enchanting realm of storytelling with cutting-edge AI technology, aiming to not only entertain but also foster emotional, intellectual, and social development in children. This vision serves as our guiding light towards a future where screen time transforms into a fun, constructive and enriching experience for all young users. Challenges have been an integral part of our growth story at AIDA. Building a platform that prioritizes children's mental health, personal development, and ethical considerations has posed its share of obstacles. Upholding strict security measures, creating a place where everyone feels included, and ensuring ethical storytelling practices are some of the challenges we continue to address earnestly. Furthermore, navigating the delicate balance between AI integration and human-led education has required meticulous planning and unwavering dedication to nurturing creativity and emotional intelligence in children. Our strategic direction is anchored in responsibility, innovation, and inclusivity. AIDA places a premium on the responsible and ethical use of AI technologies, with stringent measures in place to safeguard privacy, promote transparency, and uphold the highest standards. By establishing an internal advisory board comprising experts in AI, ethics, and education, we ensure continuous oversight and alignment with our ethical principles. Innovation is at the heart of our strategic roadmap, as we envision a dynamic and ever-evolving platform that continuously enhances storytelling experiences and social features through collaboration with external partners and experts. Inclusivity lies at the core of AIDA's strategic direction, as we strive to create a global community that transcends cultural and social boundaries. By expanding into multiple languages, engaging diverse populations, and partnering with educational institutions worldwide, we are committed to making our platform accessible and enriching for children from all walks of life. Through collaboration with authors and a dedication to nurturing creativity and ethical awareness, we aim to empower storytellers and inspire young minds to explore new horizons and possibilities. As we move forward, our focus remains unwaveringly on our mission to redefine children's digital engagement and transform screen time into a holistic and educational experience. By measuring our impact through key performance indicators and maintaining accountability in our practices, we ensure that every step we take aligns with our vision of nurturing a digital generation that is creative, empathetic, and ethically aware.

We develop Robo, the robot that pushes the limits of what’s possible. It’s a primitive machine that exhibits the most lifelike behavior ever seen. This is made possible by our experimental, molecular biology-inspired AI, which mimics the behavior of a conscious animal. We continue to test and refine Robo, hopeful that this is the long-sought breakthrough in robotics. (We’re very serious about this: we either revolutionize robotics with our technology or close the company.) Robo.bot, Inc. is currently in a stealth phase, with R&D teams operational across several countries.

We do this by: 1) Leveraging our extensive network of renewables developers to identify suitable renewable energy projects. 2) Using our AI powered contracting ecosystem to help corporate buyers plan and run Request for Proposals (RFPs) OR choose RE projects from a pre-vetted list prepared by the Power Dime team 3) Using our proprietary RE PPA term sheet templates to negotiate and agree the term sheet with the RE developer and corporate buyer(s) 4) Facilitating the RE PPA securitization process through our dedicated Financial Institutional (FI) partners 5) Offering the securitized RE PPAs as ‘Green Digital Securities’ (RE DSOs) bundled with Smart Contracts enabled carbon credits generated by underlying projects to our corporate buyers. 6) Providing post deal project tracking information and other relevant updates through a dedicated customer dashboard 7) Providing in-depth renewable energy market intelligence, helping corporate buyers understand the market & plan their procurement strategy Our approach helps our clients by: 1) Transferring the responsibility of engaging with multiple developers to find suitable RE projects and RE PPA structuring & negotiations to Power Dime’s highly experienced PPA negotiators 2) Eliminating the need to engage with multiple 3rd party consultants to conduct pre-deal project and contract due diligence; Power Dime will manage these interfaces for them 3) Providing them access to highly traceable and auditable RE DSOs and carbon credits that help address any greenwashing regulatory scrutiny 4) Through RE DSOs offering the benefit of fractional ownership of large scale renewables projects across multiple locations (esp. benefiting SMEs and companies with limited power load requirements)

Our mission is to positively disrupt the way people plan for their future with secure, trusted, and user-friendly digital Will and legacy planning solutions. The death of a loved one is an emotional and at times traumatic experience. Unfortunately, the process of managing their affairs is generally complex, bureaucratic and archaic. It’s a life event that most of us don’t need to experience many times in our lives, but when we do, we want to spend our time on remembering our loved one, not on searching for information, filling out documents, and finding out how little we know. adeus replaces the disparate web of paper documents, filing cabinets, and multiple online accounts with a single secure solution built on distributed ledger technology, enabled by AI. From critical documents like wills and power of attorneys, to providing guidance to access to your digital life stored on cloud platforms and social media applications, adeus ensures that your most precious possessions and thoughts are easy to find, and to access by your next of kin when you say 'adeus’, or goodbye to this life.

According to research by Public Health Rev, 29 August 2023, many African countries like Uganda do not prioritize healthcare data systems. This leads to a prevalence of paper-based medical recording tools and desktop solutions that are prone to damage and disconnected thus making patients' medical information inaccessible. Medstow integrates a patient's comprehensive medical information from various disconnected sources and presents it alongside valuable insights through an AI-powered mobile application and web portal. The key features include secure data storage, AI-powered Insights, and dependents’ account registration e.g. children, elderly, and people with disabilities. Medstow gives individuals back the power to own and conveniently access their medical information, enhances patient care, improves disease trend analysis, and medical data sharing between facilities and patients. Unlike other solutions, Medstow serves both patients and healthcare facilities. It is tier-priced with 20MB free, 20-100MB at $0.5, and $0.8 above 100MB

You'd also need to know if your competitor launches a new product, to inform your product team about the state of the market.

Jun 6, 2024
Many potential users of AI are held back by the worry that their project may not be compliant with current or future regulations. This can apply if you use AI in any part of your organization. In the worst case you may have to abandon your AI project, or face fines or other penalties. Use our audit tool to understand issues that may affect your plans. You can purchase a digital audit, which uses Dynamic Knowledge Graph technology, to ask a series of questions to establish current and future compliance considerations for your application in a single jurisdiction. Currently we support the USA, the EU and the UK as jurisdictions. We are working on adding more. Unlike Generative AI-based technology, the Knowledge Graph operation is transparent, traceable and repeatable, and thus we can ensure the reliability of the results and rapidly adapt to changes in compliance and AI technology. The results of the audit will be presented on screen and as a downloadable PDF link.
