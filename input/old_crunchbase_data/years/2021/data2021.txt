The team at Themis AI has implemented more than 5 years of foundational research into a software framework that automatically estimates uncertainty for any ML model. Unpredictable variations in model output quality have led to a reluctance of users to accept AI as part of their lives and integrate it into workflows. Uncertainty estimation is a necessary process that addresses this issue. In short, an understanding of model reliability is needed for proper quality assurance. Capsa allows ML models to recognize when they provide improper results and self-regulate.Themis AI was founded in 2021.

Dec 31, 2020
Imagine a world where 32% of all deaths could be prevented with accurate and timely diagnoses. Unfortunately, misdiagnoses of cardiovascular disease (CD) are all too common in pre-specialist settings. Often, the first test to investigate the heart of a potential CD patient is an electrocardiogram (ECG) performed and analyzed by non-specialists. But what if these healthcare professionals had access to a tool that could make interpreting ECGs easy and accurate? Our survey of health professionals revealed that less than half felt confident interpreting ECGs, 60% found it difficult to diagnose based on ECG recordings and only 2% trusted the suggestions from their current device. HATO utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in real-time and provide accurate and timely diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases. Our agnostic software solution utilizes deep learning to quickly identify and understand abnormalities in the heart, and agnostic software provides healthcare professionals with a real-time view of the patient's heart to assist in locating abnormalities and reacting quickly in critical situations. This helps to ensure rapid and accurate decision-making for appropriate patient visitation, triage, and treatment, as well as for healthcare professionals who may not have extensive knowledge in cardiology.

Nyckel makes it easy to auto-label images and text using AI. We say ‘easy’ because trying to do classification through complex “we-do-it-all” AI/ML tools is hard. Especially if you’re not a machine learning expert. That’s why Nyckel built a platform that makes image and text classification easy for everyone. Whether you’re sorting through images, moderating text, or needing real-time content labeling, Nyckel lets you build a custom classifier in just 5 minutes. Just add some sample images/text with the right labels, and the model will train in seconds. You can immediately upload unlabeled content and see if Nyckel identifies it correctly. You can also integrate with our Classification API to auto-label content at scale. Nyckel’s goal is to make AI-powered classification a practical tool for anyone. Learn more at Nyckel.com.

Responsum enables companies to deploy generative AI solutions to complex business problems faster than ever before without sacrificing security or performance. Let's explore how you can get started on your generative AI journey or accelerate what's already working. ChatGPT doesn't have access to your company data, but what if it did in a safe and secure way? The Responsum platform is powered by the world's best large language models (LLMs) and industry-leading AI techniques, enabling executives and senior leaders to go from idea to solution in record time. We help companies answer questions like... How should we be thinking about generative AI? How can we apply generative AI to a specific department or function? What are the risks of generative AI? Do I need to build my own custom model and how hard is that? What is the time to value and ROI for generative AI? Should we build, buy, or partner?

Those same these tools are also very clearly here to stay, as they have real utility when employed by non-malicious users. The public’s ability to trust what they see published from media and governments is paramount to our modern global society. Our solution provides a way for any company, government, or person to easily claim all of their digital assets as NFTs on a decentralized system, storing that asset’s content on a blockchain using advanced techniques that enable the detection of assets that are based on assets in the entity’s wallet of digital assets.

Sikanai is an edtech startup focusing on student-first solutions that benefit both the instructor and the student. We are two people who met in an online discussion forum focused on academic integrity. Our relationship grew sharing ideas about education using technology in novel ways. Our current focus is ghostwriting in the classroom, aka contract cheating. Plagiarism checkers don't detect ghostwriters or GPT. Research in academic integrity and contract cheating recommends that instructors read a student's submission and ask questions about their work. In an ideal world, instructors would have the time to be able to do this. Unfortunately, with pressing demands from administration, research, and life, many professors do not have the time to question students about their work - and that's why we created Auth+. Auth+ is a patent-pending ghostwriting deterrent on an AI engine. We take the first read for the instructor, question the student, and follow up with the student as needed. Auth+ detects students using an alternative author, regardless of intelligence.

Low-Code/No-Code and AI development has experienced rapid adoption and is today mainstream in large enterprises, where business-led initiatives are developed by business users who address their needs on their own, without waiting for IT or development resource allocation. On one hand, this is an amazing step forward and another wave of IT decentralization to enable organizations to push forward with digital transformation. On the other- business users are not part of traditional secure development practices nor do they have technical/security knowledge required to build secure applications. Zenity has built the first security governance platform to secure the development of low-code/no-code and AI applications. Zenity's platform is used by application security professionals who are looking to secure business application development that is taking place with low-code/no-code platforms, such that takes place in major SaaS platforms like Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow and UiPath. Zenity's platform offering is focused on 3 main pillars: (1) Visibility, (2) Risk Assessment, (3) Governance.

Taelor Logo
Taelor
11-50
2021
Taelor is a Silicon Valley-based fashion industry start-up founded by Anya Cheng, ex Facebook and Target Lead who led teams to build Facebook Shopping and Target eCommerce and a current Northwestern University faculty member. Taelor is a revolutionary new way for men to rent clothes, allowing them to look and feel great every day while also reducing their carbon footprint. The service uses a combination of Artificial Intelligence and personal stylists to select clothes for men based on their sizes and personal preferences. The clothes are shipped directly to customers, who can either wear them for two weeks and return them or purchase the clothes for up to 70% off the regular retail price. Customers then receive another box of clothes. “Our goal is to provide individuals with stylish, everyday menswear. We believe that every day is an opportunity to look good and feel confident,” said Cheng, a former digital product lead at Facebook, eBay and Target. “And when you rent clothes instead of buying them, you not only save the time and energy of having to search and shop for clothes, but you also help the environment, too, instead of purchasing clothes that will eventually end up in a landfill.” Cheng has a strong background in both the digital and retail space. A TEDx Talk speaker and best-selling book author, Cheng spent 15 years leading digital innovation teams at Facebook, eBay, Target, McDonald’s and Sears before launching Taelor. Cheng said she originally got the idea to start a clothing rental subscription service for men after becoming a huge fan of other clothing rental subscription services herself. “I became such a fan of renting clothes that I haven’t purchased any clothes for myself except for underwear for the past five years,” Cheng says. “But I realized that none of the clothing rental services really served menswear nor focuses on helping people to achieve career or personal goals in their everyday life, and I thought, men should be able to enjoy this service too so they can feel ready and confident for their day.” The popularity of sustainability practices, minimalism, and no-ownership trends have caused the clothing rental business model to explode in recent years, with some analysts projecting that the Circular Fashion industry, which includes rental and resale, could earn as much as $66 billion by 2024 in the U.S. alone. Taelor gives customers the option to choose between two different subscription packages. The first option is a flat, monthly fee, where customers get two boxes per month, which include four shirts per box. The second option is for customers to pay a one-time fee, where customers receive three boxes in total, with four shirts per box. Both options include complimentary personalized styling, dry cleaning, and shipping both ways — making the process of renting and returning clothing easy and effortless. It’s a service that is a perfect solution for busy individuals who don’t want to spend time shopping or picking out their clothes. “I want to look good, but I don't really want to spend time shopping,” says Danny Ma, one of Taelor’s first customers. “I considered clothing subscription boxes for years, but I didn’t want to commit to buying something from each box. After using Taelor, I am much more confident!” For more information about Taelor, please visit https://taelor.style. For investment inquiries or schedule media interview, please contact hi@taelor.ai

zypl.ai applies 'no data' AI at scale to advance financial inclusion in emerging and frontier markets. Our SaaS solution enables banks and microfinance organizations to instantly and accurate underwrite loans, both offline and digitally, to consumers with limited or no credit history. zypl's proprietary approach includes training AI models on synthetically generated data with simulation of 'black swan' conditions, providing stable and adaptable SaaS in spite of macro volatility in developing markets. Apart from analyzing traditional variables such as social, demographic, and professional background of clients, our SaaS reviews device metadata, psychometrics, web trace, and macroeconomic factors to arrive at credit decisions. In the process, we fully customize AI models to risk appetite of each individual enterprise partner with the goal of reflecting their competitive market advantages. Additionally, we offer complete flexibility on mode of integration through either cloud or on-premise deployment based on enterprise preference. We only deploy explainable AI models with embedded 'weight-of-evidence' interpretation of each decision made by the software, complying with emerging regulatory requirements on credit scoring. Having launched our beta last year, we have scaled presence to 10 enterprise clients in 4 markets across Central Asia.

2021
Imagine: a teleprompter stops working midway through a live program. A lighting grid suddenly turns off during taping, and a pair of premium cinema cameras stop functioning on a film set. In 90% of cases, interruptions on set can be traced back to high-end production equipment failure. And downtime in our industry costs money – adding up fast to break budgets and even end careers. While common business systems like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) or CRM (Customer Relationship Management) have digitalized wide parts of businesses and AI has taken center stage in the media supply chain, the management of production technology assets is still quite analog and fragmented, requiring manual data entry and monitoring from the workforce. Beam Dynamics is helping film & broadcast productions manage, maintain, and grow their critical technology infrastructure. The Beam enterprise asset management platform provides engineers access to all critical security patches, firmware updates, documentation, and contact information from over 5,000 vendors and close to a million products in a single user interface. Simply by uploading an inventory list with the model # and manufacturer, engineers get access to a rich set of critical data to keep productions on-air, on time, and on-budget.

GOFA International, a leader in AI-powered Fitness & Education Technology, has launched two new wellness apps "GOFA Fitness." and "Luca & Friends." The company, which is on a mission to transform lifestyles, says the wellness apps are meant to confront an epidemic of unhealthy lifestyles through the use of proprietary AI technology. One app is aimed at adults and uses AI to deliver accessible personal training at home, while the other combines education and movement, and is aimed at children ages 4 to 8. The apps are meant to act as a countermeasure to people who inhabit a world where hours are spent at desks every day, and children spend increasing amounts of time in front of their screens. In June 2021, the firm raised US$2.3 million from angel investors through seed funding, at which point the company was valued at $20 million (USD). Since then, GOFA International has built industry-leading AI-powered products and applications and expanded its team of 50 to offices in San Francisco, India, and Hong Kong.

Worddio: Vocabualry builder Logo
Worddio: Vocabualry builder
11-50
2021
Worddio is an AI-driven vocabulary-building app. We are growing our user base at a rapid pace because we offer our customers: - The unique feature to learn words without touching their smartphone. - 34 languages that cover 90% of the world's population. Our in-house AI/ML models help us in: - Building individual learning paths. - Optimizing marketing costs. - Deep user database segmentation (psychological, behavioral, and interests based) Customer Problem The main problem we face is the language barrier between peoples. This specifically applies to EU as a multi-lingual community. From other hand the biggest challenge for learning a foreign language is time. Advanced online technologies provide many learning opportunities but all of them require 100% focus for a long period of time which many people do not have. Products & Services To solve this problem, we turned the flashcards that students often use to memorize words into audio flashcards. Over 2000 people say that Worddio is a great tool for learning new words. With Worddio you can learn new words on the move or while doing something else, without touching your phone. Through this method, the learner will also memorize the pronunciation in the correct way, spoken by a native language speaker. We safe students time! Target Market The Worddio app is designed specifically for people learning a foreign language and who don't have time to learn and memorize new words. The Global Online Language Learning Market was valued at $12.49 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $25.73 billion by 2027. With its 34 languages Worddio has potential usefulness for over 90% of the world population. Does it work? We have more than 200K installations and more than 1300 paying users. Business Model - subscriptions: 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, lifetime - up-sales of premium content - advanced flashcards by topics, Audiobooks and Podcasts. - Ads - general or targeted based on user profiles - Apply data & technology to other platforms/apps/fields . . . Developing a B2C model on a global level takes time and resources to break even, but once that happens, the return on investment is maximized at scale. Customer Segments Professionals: adults looking to improve their foreign-language skills for business or career reasons Casual learners: travelers, expats, or other persons wishing to learn a new language or enhance their current knowledge Sector-specific: Service workers, such as call-center staff or healthcare workers, who can perform better with a larger vocabulary and accurate pronunciation. Youth: 12-20 year-olds studying secondary languages in schools Sales & Marketing Strategy We have technology that allows us to build psychological profiles and predict users' behaviours without accessing their sensitive data. We can build bespoke learning paths, custom sales funnels, and target ads. The data gathered allow the pursue of three main objectives: optimzing marketing resources by leveraging predictive machine learning models creating individual learning paths based on users needs upsale of particular content or products Competitors The language learning apps space looks crowded but in fact there is a specific empty niche - passive learning. There are a lot of language learning apps on the market, but none of them use a passive learning method to save time for their users - Worddio is the only one that does. We are opening a new market group to support language learning. The Worddio app is a pseudo-passive learning app powered by AI which saves student time. Competitive Advantage Worddio main advantages are: - our app’s passive learning method - huge stock of professionally recorded audio-flashcards in 34 languages. - scientific-based approach that leverages ML and AI to optimize costs and improve user experience - premium content section - AI features that will help us deliver the ultimate hands-free experience to our users.

Our platform integrates purpose-built experimental protocols, proprietary datasets and advanced design algorithms to accelerate product design and development, from personalized cell therapies to precision fermentation. Officinae Bio comes from the Latin word officinae meaning “the shop where things are designed and manufactured”. Our name reflects our mission to become the leading platform for biology design and build. What are we building? We’re working to overcome the greatest challenges to a future built with biology; starting with the DNA at the core of all biological engineering. Vulcanus - automated pipelines for long and complex DNA constructs Vulcanus is the first AI-driven pipeline to automate the entire process of building large and complex DNA; from oligo design to fragment assembly. Vulcanus is capable of designing optimal protocols for the build of long and complex DNA constructs up to 50kbp at a 93% success rate - nearly double the success rate of industry standard in time frames that make possible rapid development and screening cycles. Named after the latin god of the forge. Vulcanus was believed to have built the most sophisticated items of ancient lore, including Jupiter’s lightning bolts and Mercury’s winged helm. Ulysses - navigate biological complexity to design superior products Having mastered DNA build, we are developing solutions to the next bottleneck to building with Biology: design. Our Ulysses algorithm is enabling the smart navigation of complex option spaces when designing biological systems such as cell lines and strains. Ulysses leverages approaches for the design of the whole system rather than engineering individual parts. By recognizing the interconnectivity of all parameters and their nonlinear interactions of the system it allows for more robust, scaleable biological production and designs. Ulysses was the legendary Greek hero and king of Ithaca. His most famous journey was his ten-year struggle to return home through challenges and obstacles but he cleverly navigated through them with his wit and intellect. Next generation, scalable production systems With the foundations of DNA and design mastered, we are turning our unique approach to complexity, computation, automation and molecular biology to build the next generation of biological production systems. Our unique approach aims to overcome the challenges to scalability, predictability and purity of microbial production systems.

BeachEdge is a ConTech startup that is making beach homes a reality for the modern day professional. These are hassle free, affordable and cash flow generating beach houses. Ownership of a second home is not nearly as accessible as it used to be 30 years ago, when it was very common for middle-class and upper middle class professionals to have a second property. As inflation outpaced wage growth over the years, it is now generally a luxury reserved for the very wealthy. We are giving an overlooked group of the current generation a reasonable opportunity to experience what has been taken away from them by time: ownership of a vacation home and ownership of hard cash flow asset. Through the use of our ai driven technology and our experience, we are able to make this a reality.

The core of the business model is to generate users through its own content via www.mediorbis.de and then monetize them through self-developed apps, relevant affiliate marketing and target group-specific online advertising. As the next leading data-driven publisher of freely accessible medical content, IT and AI applications in Germany, mediorbis is now aiming to massively expand its own content and roll out its portfolio of products and services internationally. As a fast-growing company, mediorbis GmbH is constantly developing new SEO-optimized content with 50 editors from 7 European countries. Currently, mediorbis GmbH has about 116 SEO-optimized guides with about 824,340 words in 10 medical topics. In the future, it is planned to cover up to 50 medical subject areas with approx. 2,500 digital guides. Year-on-year from June 22 to June 23, the number of monthly visitors increased by 482%, while the company's revenue doubled. In terms of content strategy and placement, mediorbis GmbH follows a steadily growing evergreen approach. In addition to medical guides, the company also produces content for LinkedIn, Youtube and other social media channels. mediorbis GmbH currently generates sales with: - IT services for physicians and pharmacists - Applications for patients, doctors and/or pharmacists - Marketing of products on own websites via affiliates deals - Marketing of advertising space on own websites Another business area of mediorbis GmbH that is not yet included in the business plan is artificial intelligence: frag.mediorbis.de is the first AI on the German market that is trained with comprehensive health information as well as all medical treatment guidelines. This allows mediorbis to respond to your questions individually and provide them with individualized answers. In order to be able to leverage the high potential of the company as efficiently and, above all, quickly as possible, the shareholders of mediorbis GmbH have decided to carry out a crowdfunding initiative. As an important step on the way to becoming the largest health portal in Europe, this initiative raises capital in particular for the expansion of the health guides, as well as their internationalization and accelerates the company's growth.

Hardware-free scalable and sustainable AI. We are democratizing Artificial Intelligence through software innovations. UNIQUE APPROACH. ThirdAI accelerator builds hash-based processing algorithms for training and inference with neural networks. The technology is a result of 10 years of innovation in finding efficient (beyond tensor) mathematics for deep learning. Our algorithmic innovation has demonstrated how we can make Commodity x86 CPUs 15x or faster than most potent NVIDIA GPUs for training large neural networks. The demonstration has shaken the common knowledge prevailing in the AI community that specialized processors like GPUs are significantly superior to CPUs for training neural networks. Several media outlets echo our technological superiority: IEEE Spectrum describes, "What they report is stunning." Investorplace considers the algorithm one of the biggest threats to NVIDIA Stock (a $500 billion company). Engadget calls it a "Completely different approach to Deep Learning". A quote from WCCFTech says, "If an implementation of this algorithm is mainstreamed it would almost instantly disrupt the dynamics of the deep learning ecosystem. Valuations of companies could change overnight." Our innovation would not only benefit current AI training by shifting to lower-cost CPUs, but it should also allow the “unlocking” of AI training workloads on GPUs that were not previously feasible.

OpenPBL uses artificial intelligence to reduce the costs of businesses and schools with the active development of behavioral skills. ... Companies are increasingly demanding from their employees the development of professional behavioral skills that will allow them not only to achieve the expected results but to achieve them in the most efficient way possible. Problem-Based Learning, or simply PBL, is a proven effective learning strategy for developing these kinds of professional behavioral skills. However, the courses of schools that traditionally apply the full PBL process, such as Harvard, Minerva School, and École 42 are expensive and not accessible to most professionals. The OpenPBL's mission is to democratize the "problem-based professional education", allowing access to learning experiences based on typical career problems. ... The company is currently promoting a fundraising roadshow. More details on https://bit.ly/OpenPBL-Business-Pitch.

speechx provides desktop and mobile apps that analyse a user's voice, during online meetings or rehearsal sessions, and provides AI-generated recommendations that improve critical speaking parameters like clarity, brevity, inclusivity and confidence. During a live work meeting, speechx provides real-time insights into pace, volume, contribution and fillers; helping users correct their speaking style on the fly. Post-meeting, speechx generates deeper insights by analysing the language used to determine how the user performed on critical speaking parameters. speechx works in conjunction with the 800+ commonly used communication tools; analyses user's voice discreetly and does not record or store conversations by default (there is a opt-in feature to do this though) speechx also provides a safe environment for users to rehearse important conversations and repeat till they are happy with their vocal delivery. speechx gamifies the user experience enabling users to set, measure and achieve their communication goals (read: Fitbit for Communication Training). speechx provides aggregated insights to managers & coaches in enterprise deployments.

Buzz Chat Inc. (stylized as BuzzChat) is an African social media app that was released in 2021, and developed by Frederick Abila. Alongside advanced features for sharing digital content, as well as the ability to accommodate small e-commerce stores, it is specifically known for hosting a selection of AI assistants that encourage users to talk about their mental health, business ideas, and career ambitions. Critics noted its emphasis on bringing a new social networking wave across Africa, with a seemingly similar global strategy to Elon Musk's X. The name "Buzz" comes from the social alignment one associates with vibrating notifications, as well as two of the word's definitions: excitement and phone calls. According to the app's description on Google's Play Store, BuzzChat encourages its users to interact with a "digital ecosystem," emphasizing the brand's ambitions to become what's beginning to be known as an 'everything app'. Although it began with relative obscurity, it rapidly gained its first 5,000 users and continues to grow.

Geescore™ Logo
Geescore™
11-50
Mar 5, 2021
Geescore operates a jobseeker scoring service that helps hiring companies find high quality, suitable candidates. The service includes custom screening questions, and fraud detection to ensure the jobseeker’s resume is not fake or exaggerated. The service is available via API as well as with an embeddable javascript widget, for websites with job postings and career pages. Number 1 Problem in Hiring The number one problem in hiring is finding suitable, high scoring candidates. Geescore scores, matches and engages with jobseekers before they apply, and even if they don’t apply. You can try the jobseeker scoring service for yourself at https://myjobscore.com Proof of Awesomeness Every time a jobseeker is scored they are given a free downloadable PDF called “the proof of awesomeness” with all the information related to their score, ready to be sent in with a resume when applying for the job. The PDF is a handy resource perfect for hiring managers to review the jobseeker’s score, link to their LinkedIn profile, download the resume, and more. Validated No Bias Scoring Every day we test and verify that the Geescore scoring service is operating properly, and accurately scoring jobseekers without bias. We do not use data that could create bias in the scoring service, for example; ethnicity, religion, age, race, country of origin, post-hiring data and more. Easy to Use API and built-in dashboards Geescore operates in both the front-end and back-end. This means a hiring manager can access a built-in dashboard right inside a job posting to review the Scoring Metagraph, sort jobseeker scores, and more. They can also access the Scoring Metagraph via open API ready for integration to any platform to access data, analytics, scoring, custom scoring and fraud detection. The Bottom Line - how Geescore helps Recruiters and Hiring Managers The emergence of AI tools for jobseekers to fake or exaggerate a resume, and then to apply to hundreds of jobs automatically, is creating serious challenges for Recruiters and Hiring Managers. Today, with these AI tools, the number could be only 1 in a 1,000 applications, that come from qualified candidates. Seeing a validated score for a jobseeker, instantly gives Recruiters and Hiring Managers a great advantage. They can identify and direct their focus on to the best candidates, with “high touch” attention, in an effort to beat the competition; all trying to hire the best. Geescore reduces the cost and workload of Recruiters and Hiring Managers. AI is creating a lot more work for Recruiters and Hiring Managers - such as more reference checks, more interviews, longer probationary periods and signed undertakings from applicants. The Bottom Line - how Geescore helps Jobseekers Submitting an application doesn’t guarantee a job offer. In fact, hiring companies are adding defensive measures to combat AI based fake and exaggerated resumes, and auto apply tools. Why not just apply to a lot of jobs? A Jobseeker looking to advance through interviews, should focus on opportunities where they are a good fit. Where they get a high score. A jobseeker needs to have the experience and qualifications to get through interviews, and the hiring process.

Mar 30, 2021
Gartner recently estimated that poor data quality costs U.S organizations an average of $12.9 million per year, which is a staggering sum. To put this in perspective, the average cost of a data breach is $4.24 million, according to IBM’s “Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021.” If we add to this reality the fact that the volume per minute of generated data is rocketing, we can easily understand the importance of good data to making right decisions. Every year companies lost revenues and competitive advantage due to reputational, logistics, sales, marketing, regulatory costs due to the use of bad data. Omma Data is the first data quality platform designed for business users (no code needed) that solve one big global challenge: CHECK THE QUALITY OF THE DATA THAT THE COMPANIES ARE USING TO MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS. OMMA helps by at least 92% to improve the quality of the data of your company giving you a clear competitive advantage. OMMA is a big data native tool (efficient and super-fast), with a 20 times faster deployment time, avoiding the need of big tech teams, that can apply quality to any stage of the data life cycle. We want to help your company to check that the data that enters the data lake meets business requirements before it is used by business users in an easy to use, flexible and cheaper tool. We want to help companies to become more “data driven” and better prepared for the future challenges.

Feb 22, 2021
Food is the backbone of human survival. What began as a survival instinct, food has evolved to embody our contemporary civilization in all its aspects. Food culture is ubiquitous and intertwined with our daily life with diversified food choices from around the world. This immense possibility of choices has given rise to a very basic problem of decision-making in our lives: “what should I eat today?”, a trademark dilemma of at least 1 out of 10 people in your life presumably. To resolve this daily challenge of decision making in choosing what to eat, we have developed Pikky, an AI driven personalized recommendation engine designed to simplify this process. Pikky’s engine not only simplifies the process of choosing what to eat but also maximizes satisfaction from your food choices. We pride ourselves in committing to assist you in every step of experiencing this unique food ecosystem. The journey begins with the most important step where we try to understand you and your food habits. Then with every use, Pikky analyzes every aspect of your food habit and exploratory food behavior and creates à la carte curated only for you. You have the flexibility to choose from our curated recommendations or explore by yourself to see what all the restaurants in your vicinity have to offer. After you have finally come to a decision, we reach the climax of the journey where we bring food to your doorstep so that you are optimally satisfied with your food choice and our recommendation.

Vammon is a Saas platform designed for logistics optimization, using it you can manage your logistics flows In/Out collaborating with customers and suppliers who are companies or transporters. It is possible to manage price auctions, book loads, issue transport orders, confirm availability of material, manage travel documents, certificates, communications between the parties and traceability of the goods, but also manage transport problems, reservations of loading and unloading at the loading docks or on third-party platforms, and all WITHOUT making phone calls or writing emails. All this collected data provides detailed analysis on flows allow you to define the best routes, analyze times or quantities of material shipped to evaluate variations in work programs. It is finally possible to have certain data on the impact generated for Scope 3, in fact every transport is managed separately from the others and has, among other things, certain data on the vehicles used and the distances travelled, and therefore on the impact generated. We calculate that a company that moves 500 packages (in different shipments) can save up to 1500 hours of work in one year. The target customer is any company that produces, processes, reworks or markets products that needs to ship material on pallets or in large boxes that cannot be moved manually or without the use of transport equipment handling, or companies that need to manage arrivals and departures from their warehouses, or freight forwarders or couriers who handle large quantities of material. To date, Saas Vammon seems to be the only one that allows the management of shipments and dialogue between company/transporter/supplier at 360 degrees and without constraints, all other platforms are for use exclusive to the customers of individual transporters or forces customers to exchange messages and emails for negotiations.

Leverage Robotics is a spin-off of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), founded in April 2021 in Munich. We are developing a highly flexible and intelligent robot cell for fast setup and multi-task applications. For this purpose, we have developed a robot hardware toolbox with a generalized tool base that can be picked up by the robot and enables the realization of different tasks with the same robot, in particular logistics, assembly, quality or packaging of complex products. Each of these tools has corresponding pre-programmed software modules, i.e. robot skills, and additionally strategy skills for intuitive robot programming for non-experts. To ensure safety, access, and economical speeds when operating robots without a safety fence, we always inflate an airbag with compressed air before the robot moves and cover dangerous sharp-edged tools and workpieces. When the robot stops or moves slowly, we retract the airbag to maintain full tool functionality and workpiece handling.

Company Goals •Implementation of automatic speech recognition and speech emotion recognition in the safety of navigation. •Introduction of beamforming microphones in the marine environment •Access to data from connected sensors and audio recordings of helm orders as additionalevidence in case of investigation as a supplement to data from existing VDR or S-VDRdevices – the practice has shown that in case of a maritime accident, audio recordingscollected from Voyage Data Recorders are often not of sufficient quality to be relevant tothe investigation, as stated in many publications. Why Now? From the technological perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field but, more importantly, by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems. What problems are we solving for a specific customer? Helm Order Monitor is the first technological solution to the problem of insufficient monitoring of helm orders between helmsman and pilot or navigator onboard ships. Communication problems cause more than 40% of accidents at sea. Did you know that the disaster of Costa Concordia happened due to the helmsman applying the helm on the wrong side shortly before the impact? We are fixing this problem with an electronic device that combines automatic speech recognition and data from the ship's sensors. The device monitors, in accordance with maritime regulations and in conjunction with the ship’s sensor data, whether the issued helm orders are clear, confirmed, and correctly executed. Helm Order Monitor is like Lane Departure Warning to use an analogy with road transportation. Below are the main problems that Helm Order Monitor solves: •The most apparent problem is that nothing prevents a helmsman from putting therudder over the wrong way. The helmsman can also misinterpret or otherwise wrongly execute issued helm orders. •Most automated warnings are not available in hand steering, such as Default RoTdeviation warning, Drift limit alarm, Max. rudder alarm and Low-speed alarm. •Monitoring of helm orders requires a high level of concentration which reduces situational awareness. •Unsafe stress level is another significant contributor to navigational incidents. How do we reach our customers? We will attain sales through these programs: Marketing through partnerships, regulation entities, and social media, Marine Expos and Conferences, Nautical Simulator Demonstrations, and Ship Demonstrations. The ultimate goal for Helm Order Monitor is to achieve mandatory status on all merchant ships over 3000 GRT and all passenger ships regardless of their size.

Sysparency revolutionizes the profitable use of SAP® in the enterprise by introducing the first fully automated and digital SAP consultant. Most SAP-based customers have hidden the majority of their unique selling points (USPs) in undocumented and therefore poorly manageable SAP z extensions. This makes consolidation, expansion, maintenance or even migration to S/4 HANA almost impossible for companies - or only very time-consuming and therefore very costly to implement. This is where Sysparency comes into play: with its sophisticated Codeminig technology, it gives SAP customers control over their most important business know-how and, above all, ensures greater innovation capability and faster time to market. All self-developed z-transactions are documented fully automatically and explained with AI in such a way that they are not only made accessible to the department, but are also available in the AI-based SYSPARENCY smartWIKI, which practically has the knowledge of an SAP consultant and can be consulted intelligently via queries. Sysparency understands the growing complexity of the business world and offers solutions that enable companies to become more agile, efficient and competitive.

TREES.app Logo
TREES.app
1-10
Apr 15, 2021
We've created a recommendation engine for life that helps individuals engage and thrive in large organizations. The TREES app provides the right student or employee with the right resource/plan at the right time. Users complete a psychometric/habit/demographic questionnaire using a novel "slider" (patent pending), then the app reorders staff- and user-generated plans into what is most likely to work for the user, based on ratings by similar users. These plans increasingly start with short-form videos as those are getting the best engagement. Initial trials of the app were for university students and oriented towards providing plans to indigenous students, youth with disabilities entering the workforce, and people afflicted by mental health issues. Now, eight new universities are set to come on board to provide our service to foster youth in the United States, Canada, and South Africa. Universities and colleges have been a great starting place. We are focused on growing in that market and refining our product. In the long run, however, the function of the app opens the possibility for questions and plans to be catered to just about any audience while using the same technology, allowing us to potentially help countless other groups. All it takes is questions and plans (which the AI helps improve over time) and a user base (at least 1,000 users) who want to achieve something. For university students that "something" is belonging and academic success. For other trials, we've had interest in rollouts for sales success, job success, mental health, addiction recovery, or being a great parent.

Edlano is a micro-learning platform that can help people learn faster and more efficiently. Our platform is based on two main drivers, artificial intelligence and gamification. AI engines personalize contents and all of its different variables to make a unique learning path for each individual user. For instance, we might customize the interface, change playback speed, substitute the contents, and choose different interactive questions based on their behavior with the aim of saving time and inventing a wonderful experience. On the other hand, a gamification system would build an intrinsic motivation depending on the learner's player type in order to enjoy their way of mastery. For example, we use different game elements like leaderboard, special badges, streak days, and point system in non-game contexts like education. The combination of these drivers can create a delightful learning atmosphere. We are creating a new paradigm in the world of education.

Prophyles is reinventing Contact Management by pioneering a new category coined as Contacts-as-a-Service (CaaS). Prophyles is solving the lingering problems in contact management related to data integrity, accuracy, synchronization, up-to-date, and privacy. All current vendors, from low-end address books to high-end CRMs, use a centralized database which causes silos which are the main source of the problems. Prophyles took a unique and contrarian approach by using a decentralized and distributed database in a peer-to-peer network in which profiles are connected using "Smart Contracts" in a blockchain - which is the core of our patent. Prophyles provides your entire digital footprint and those of your contacts, without ever compromising your or their privacy, and without ever being outdated since all Personal Information is constantly updated from the cloud onto your or their device, just like updates of mobile apps. Prophyles offers you the most comprehensive and protected profile; reduces the probability of identity theft; connects you easily and safely with others through customizable digital cards that represent your different personas which prevent hackers, spammers, or even online predators from preying on your children; leverages your social network by capitalizing on the strength of your weak ties to get you qualified referrals; gets the latest scoop from social media about your contacts; finds people near you; records your daily events in a personalized diary; organizes your ideas in a customized journal; generates flavors of your resumes that are fed to job boards; completes online forms through AI-empowered APIs for you so that you don’t have to, etc. In short, Prophyles is your digital footprint in a truly connected and more secured new online world.

Trang Blog này là một cẩm nang về kim cương và các loại đá quý mà chúng tôi tổng hợp từ những nguồn thông tin chính thống được cung cấp bởi các nhà sản xuất đến các chuyên gia hàng đầu nghiên cứu về lĩnh vực đá quý trên khắp thế giới. Với những bài viết của mình, chúng tôi hy vọng có thể giúp các bạn độc giả yêu quý trang bị được những kiến thức cần thiết để có thể tự đánh giá được phần nào chất lượng của viên kim cương cũng như đá quý dựa theo màu sắc, độ tinh khiết, giác cắt và trọng lượng, để tránh khỏi những chiêu trò độn giá hoặc mua phải những viên kim cương kém chất lượng với số tiền quá lớn. Nhiều người bày tỏ sự bất ngờ và tò mò tại sao chúng tôi làm ra thư viện kiến thức khổng lồ này một cách miễn phí cho mọi người. Bởi chính chúng tôi, những người đã lăn lội rất lâu tại thị trường kim cương đá quý ở nước ngoài, cũng phải chật vật rất nhiều mà vẫn chưa tìm được một viên kim cương chất lượng phù hợp với túi tiền. Và tôi tin rằng nhiều người Việt Nam cũng vậy. Nên kimcuongdaquy.info được tạo ra với vai trò như một tòa thư viện thu nhỏ ghi chép đầy đủ kiến thức chuyên môn cũng như thông tin về các nơi mua bán kim cương uy tín, giúp những ai đang bối rối có thể lựa chọn được viên đá tốt nhất với ngân sách của mình.

Edlano is a micro-learning platform that can help people learn faster and more efficiently. Our platform is based on two main drivers, artificial intelligence and gamification. AI engines personalize contents and all of its different variables to make a unique learning path for each individual user. For instance, we might customize the interface, change playback speed, substitute the contents, and choose different interactive questions based on their behavior with the aim of saving time and inventing a wonderful experience. On the other hand, a gamification system would build an intrinsic motivation depending on the learner's player type in order to enjoy their way of mastery. For example, we use different game elements like leaderboard, special badges, streak days, and point system in non-game contexts like education. The combination of these drivers can create a delightful learning atmosphere. We are creating a new paradigm in the world of education.

Prophyles is solving the lingering problems in contact management related to data integrity, accuracy, synchronization, up-to-date, and privacy. All current vendors, from low-end address books to high-end CRMs, use a centralized database which causes silos which are the main source of the problems. Prophyles took a unique and contrarian approach by using a decentralized and distributed database in a peer-to-peer network in which profiles are connected using "Smart Contracts" in a blockchain - which is the core of our patent. Prophyles provides your entire digital footprint and those of your contacts, without ever compromising your or their privacy, and without ever being outdated since all Personal Information is constantly updated from the cloud onto your or their device, just like updates of mobile apps. Prophyles offers you the most comprehensive and protected profile; reduces the probability of identity theft; connects you easily and safely with others through customizable digital cards that represent your different personas which prevent hackers, spammers, or even online predators from preying on your children; leverages your social network by capitalizing on the strength of your weak ties to get you qualified referrals; gets the latest scoop from social media about your contacts; finds people near you; records your daily events in a personalized diary; organizes your ideas in a customized journal; generates flavors of your resumes that are fed to job boards; completes online forms through AI-empowered APIs for you so that you don’t have to, etc. In short, Prophyles is your digital footprint in a truly connected and more secured new online world.

Trang Blog này là một cẩm nang về kim cương và các loại đá quý mà chúng tôi tổng hợp từ những nguồn thông tin chính thống được cung cấp bởi các nhà sản xuất đến các chuyên gia hàng đầu nghiên cứu về lĩnh vực đá quý trên khắp thế giới. Với những bài viết của mình, chúng tôi hy vọng có thể giúp các bạn độc giả yêu quý trang bị được những kiến thức cần thiết để có thể tự đánh giá được phần nào chất lượng của viên kim cương cũng như đá quý dựa theo màu sắc, độ tinh khiết, giác cắt và trọng lượng, để tránh khỏi những chiêu trò độn giá hoặc mua phải những viên kim cương kém chất lượng với số tiền quá lớn. Nhiều người bày tỏ sự bất ngờ và tò mò tại sao chúng tôi làm ra thư viện kiến thức khổng lồ này một cách miễn phí cho mọi người. Bởi chính chúng tôi, những người đã lăn lội rất lâu tại thị trường kim cương đá quý ở nước ngoài, cũng phải chật vật rất nhiều mà vẫn chưa tìm được một viên kim cương chất lượng phù hợp với túi tiền. Và tôi tin rằng nhiều người Việt Nam cũng vậy. Nên kimcuongdaquy.info được tạo ra với vai trò như một tòa thư viện thu nhỏ ghi chép đầy đủ kiến thức chuyên môn cũng như thông tin về các nơi mua bán kim cương uy tín, giúp những ai đang bối rối có thể lựa chọn được viên đá tốt nhất với ngân sách của mình.

MarketMind is a network of generative AI-based chatbots that talk to investors - created by founders of the world’s largest newswire and IR technology platforms. With retail investors now owning the majority of the world’s publicly-traded shares, it’s more important than ever that companies take control of their narrative on social media, stock message boards and investment research sites. Tailor-fitted to the back offices of public companies, MarketMind scans clients’ corporate materials and synthesizes this material to generate chatbot content. The platform uses predictive analytics to scan social media and other online investor conversations to help inform its large language model on anticipated questions. The result is a broad network of chatbots on multiple web sites that provide retail investors with a deeper and more accurate level of insight on clients’ operations than that which is available on public and professional stock research sites.

Circu Li-ion is a battery upcycling company headquartered in Luxembourg, with a mission to accelerate the green revolution and achieve sustainable economic electrification. Our goal is to maximize the value of each battery and promote a truly environmentally friendly approach. We distinguish ourselves from traditional recycling methods that destroy entire batteries when only 10% of cells have reached their end-of-life, wasting valuable resources. Instead, we focus on reusing still-functioning battery components, saving them from being prematurely recycled. Our automated and scalable process can recover up to 90% of end-of-life battery cells and components, greatly reducing environmental impact. With the aid of AI and machine vision, our proprietary algorithm gathers data at each stage, enabling the creation of an automated and scalable battery library. Our approach revolutionizes battery recycling, cutting costs, and reducing battery-related CO2 emissions by 48% compared to a traditional battery life cycle. We offer this cutting-edge technology to leading players in the EV, micromobility, and powertools industries, throughout the value chain from sourcing and manufacturing to recycling.

By running in some cases 100x or more investigations, Salem gives you the opportunity to identify threats that might have previously flown under the radar, leading to a decreased time-to-detect and an increased ROI of other cyber detection tech you’ve invested in.

Shopify stores use Preflect to automate their Google, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok ads. Here’s how Preflect works: 1. AI-Powered Targeting Preflect deploys your ads to Google, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Google, using AI to more profitably find new shoppers everywhere they spend their time. 2. Optimize to Sell More Preflect connects to Shopify and major ad networks, enabling you to optimize landing pages to earn more sales, and dynamically allocate budget in real-time. 3. Track iOS Shoppers We use third-party data and a proprietary media mix model to accurately track more sales in this iOS 14.5+ era, so you can automatically optimize targeting with better data, and receive clear recommendations on your ads. Ad agencies manually spend hours setting up and running your ads, then slowly try to optimize them with Facebook's poor data. Preflect makes them obsolete. You save $1,000s in fees, make better decisions using better data, and don't have to deal with their human errors.

Aug 17, 2021
An app that turns an ordinary mobile phone into a device for conducting objective neurobehavioral tests could make it easier and more cost-effective to diagnose neurological disorders. The BlinkLab smartphone application enables remote neurobehavioral testing in children and adults to help diagnose and monitor neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. The app can also be used in neuroscience and psychology research to study fundamental mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation. Until now, these tests have required dedicated hardware in a permanent lab environment with substantial face-to-face interaction between researcher and participant. The new app is user-friendly, especially for infants and autistic patients since no face attachments are needed. The BlinkLab smartphone app allows performance of neurobehavioral tests remotely using the user’s own cell phone. Anyone can do the tests by themselves at home following the user-friendly instructions provide by the app. Experiments can be programmed by the healthcare professionals or researchers and selected from a list on the smartphone by the user. Data acquired with BlinkLab can be securely shared with healthcare professionals or researchers During a typical evaluation, the user will watch an entertaining movie or play a simple video game on the smartphone, while the smartphone delivers short auditory and visual stimuli in specific patterns. A test takes about 10-20 minutes. Using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, BlinkLab will measure the motor and emotional responses of the user to these stimuli. For most experiments, the main focus will be on eye movements and eye blinks. BlinkLab provides a behavioral readout using machine-vision algorithms, which can be used to characterize specific movements at video frames.

May 15, 2021
Dynacurate solves the issue of managing ongoing changes to medical codes, clinical terminologies and controlled vocabularies. Currently ontologies in the health and life sciences sectors rely on a huge amount of manual reconciliation, but Dynaccurate's AI reduces this work from months to days, using a highly sophisticated algorithm that took many years to create. Dynaccurate is particularly relevant to the Health and Life Sciences industries as these sectors are using Clinicial Terminologies such as SNOMED, ICD, MedDRA, as well as extracts from regulatory databases. These terminologies are required to manage, for example: - Maintaining large scale knowledge graphs with multiple clinical terminologies in scope, for example in drug research - Accurate codes and terms in Electronic Patient Records - Maintaining specific Health Ontologies, for example medical procedure catalogues, such as imaging - Providing a 'semantic layer' for a health data warehouse. As health records age, codes and terms go out of date, yet Dynaccurate can provide the equivalent, in-use terms to apply on top of the records, providing equivalence across the entire body of data; - Providing updates to codes and terms used in Medical Coding, Billing and Reimbursement (for hospitals and patients); - Medical data sharing in general, especially between upstream/downstream actors, as well as cross-border. Dynaccurate can also be used in non-clinical areas, such as Controlled Vocabularies uses in Translation, Public Administration and Security & Defence.

Buzzer solves the biggest problem in sales, huge amounts of money lost each year because of leads falling through the cracks in the funnel, which roots in wrongfully rejected leads; inefficient lead distribution; bad timing of engagement and inaccurate ICP. Buzzer generates actionable insights on when & how to approach each lead and uncovers lead rescue opportunities to yield maximum revenue. Account executives and S/BDRs make everyday decisions with gut instinct which result in a huge loss of revenue, these decisions are who to approach, whom should approach, how to approach (resolving objections) and with what offering. MQL to sale conversion is somewhere between 10-20% which means that 80-90% of the budget spent on generating these leads is trashed. Buzzer eliminates the guesswork in the sales process using ML, our model helps account executives and S/BDRs to make optimal everyday decisions in order to yield the most revenue from their leads.

PrescriberPoint is “Kayak” for prescribers looking for an easier, one-stop-shop way to get their patients on therapy who may be facing complex coverage, affordability and patient start challenges. We are disrupting the $100Bn+ the pharma industry spends on healthcare providers (HCPs) which includes HCP marketing, field teams and hub-services. Our goal is to build an alternative to these fragmented, pharma-centric solutions with an HCP-centric, aggregation-based approach. Our marketplace platform aggregates all the resources HCPs need for the over 35k marketed drugs in the US to look up and evaluate a drug, research and find coverage and affordability options for patients, order samples and take other actions to get patients started on therapy. Our AI and software tools provide decision-support and workflow automation to cut down on the two days a week doctors offices report they spend dealing with these bureaucratic challenges. As a “connector” platform, like other aggregators like Kayak, Zillow and Cars.com, we are making it easy for HCPs to tap into other solutions across the prescribing journey that can help facilitate patient starts such as RTBI, ePA and pharmacy offerings. Our solution is free for HCPs. Our business model relies on charging pharma brands a monthly subscription fee for premium services designed to help targeted HCPs take advantage of the content, tools and services offered through the brand’s PrescriberPoint “microsite”.

Jul 10, 2021
We are a pre-stage startup currently in our research & development phase. Our community will be operating on an A.I based platform which is being developed by our core team. The platform will be available to the users in the form of an android/ios app and will also be accessible through the web. Our platform aims to solve the problems a student faces throughout his school and college life. Maybe it is the fear of losing in the journey or the frustration of not getting an internship/ job/skilled courses. In today's time there are many websites, companies for single work maybe the work be to receive the best career guidance or be accessing good mental health care or finding a career opportunity for that today's generation have to roam through 1000’s of websites and 100’s of apps but atlast very few people are able to get what they wanted, major thing that becomes a barrier is lack of skills and high prices for accessing these services online from various websites and app , This is where we come in our platform will eliminate these barriers and make the things easier and convenient , from now on the users will not have to roam on 100’s and 1000’s of app/web because they’ll get all that on a single community platform “Beetle”. The main thing would be that all the services would be at very reasonable prices with more than 85% of the content on the platform available for free. According to “Google” more than 20% of teenagers suffer depression at least once before entering adulthood and manier times this happens because of not getting proper counselling and mental health care at early stage, Manier times the teens hesitate to tell this to their parents and keep it all inside them which leads to depression, to eliminate this depression hypocrisy our community would be havin a proper mental health care section where counsellors and doctors would be assisting the depression/anxiety youngsters through 1 on 1 video chat or text chat apart from the regular podcasts and live sessions on mental health and motivation in life. All this would be completely free of cost. A graduation from premier Indian colleges like IIT,NIT,DTU,BITS or abroad colleges like stanford,Oxford,Harvard,MIT is not everything. Skills matter more than a degree & a lot of companies like google & cred have realised this and have brought changes in their hiring process for the same, But At Least in India people still haven't realised this yet . Beetle focuses on eradicating this thought amongst Indians by proving them wrong . We plan to develop special courses by professors of top notch Indian and abroad colleges coming together. This would be a short term skill specific diploma course in preferred subject like computer science, Electronics,etc with guaranteed internship and job in tech giants and startups to kick start their career as experienced professional, All this at upto 90% lesser fees than a premier college. Entertainment is a very crucial part of our lives which works as a stress reliever but while getting entertained if we are learning something then nothing could be better than that for a student. That's where “Beetle”brings in originals and 3rd party featured content on our platform through which students learn while getting entertained. We also plan to collaborate with ott providers like netflix,prime videos, hotstar, sony, to avail all their content for all are users on a single platform and they don’t need to now spend on buying ott subscriptions. Educational stuff i.e both academic and non academic stuff for school and college students prepared and developed by best professionals and college professors from reputed colleges. Which will help students cope up with their academic studies and there would be no need to hire a tutor. Non academic stuffs will contain finance, investments, tech, design,personality development, new language learning, etc Public & Private communities, Appart from a public community run by beetle for individual users were they can make new friends, follow other people, answer the questions posted on community handles by users something similar to quora, they can also build social profile something similar to instagram, Stream content, watch ott content with their friends in steam rooms something similar to discord. we’ll also have the option of private community which will have selected users in it upon invite of the community admin, and an extension to this will be a business private community for student organizations, institutes , school/colleges, student clubs which will be paid and with more customized feature like webinar studio, library, document locker, forums, survey builder, student portfolio etc REVENUE GENERATION STRATEGIES Initially all the features would be free of cost and our primary source would be ad revenue which means users will need to watch advertisements while accessing content from our platform. At later stages when we’ll have a decent or good amount of users then we’ll bring paid subscription which will make the platform ad free for the paid users We’ll continue with the free accounts as usual they’ll be watching ads but additionally some of the features (15%-20%) will be inaccessible for free users these 15%-20% features will come under premium category and will be available to paid users.These premium features will majorly contain exclusive live academic courses for school and college students, OTT content, Diploma courses & Training,etc

Aug 12, 2021
We believe that the proliferation of conversational & generative AI has sparked a strong desire to not only optimize automated responses, but also to create harmony among bots, agents, and knowledge workers. At SentioCX we focus on the latter as we believe that virtual agents and live agents should work together seamlessly to provide the best possible customer experience. We focus exclusively on conversation orchestration and triaging/routing conversations from digital channels/conversational AI to an agent workspace in order to provide a truly 'seamless' hand-off from bots/conversational AI to live agents. We have been granted a US patent on our routing algorithm. In fact, instead of routing conversations in queues or throwing these conversations over the fence in ‘unassigned inboxes’ we provide triaging and intelligent routing into the agent workspace and if necessary, notify reserve agents or keep low-priority conversations (based on intent) in the bot temporarily to make room for more important conversations.

+40 million people in west africa are exposed to food insecurity and famine; this is caused by successive poor harvests, due to disease, lack of access to agricultural engineers and especially of financial resources. Therefore, diagnosis is one of the most important aspects of a plant pathologist's training. Without proper identification of the disease and the causing agent, disease control measures can be a waste of time and money and can lead to further plant losses. Proper disease diagnosis is therefore vital. That’s why we are building SmartPlant AI. A digital mobile application using AI & Machine Learning to facilitate plant analysis with prevention and access to micro-loans for local smallholders; Our vision is to be an essential partner for +3 Billion smallholders in Africa, and create +10.000 jobs across africa.

Smoov Inc Logo
Smoov Inc

Sep 1, 2021
Smoov is the first platform built to help couples automatically split and manage their shared expenses, before they have a shared bank account. Millions of couples are sending money back and forth every single day and money is the number one reason relationships fail. Today the process for splitting bills and expenses is manual, time consuming, and can be awkward or tense, plus no one likes doing math. Smoov makes it automatic, accurate and easy. While mirroring consumer behavior of sending money to each other via mobile. How? Smoov integrates with users' existing credit and debit cards and pulls transactions into a private running list. This creates a very low barrier to entry and eliminates awkward conversations about signing up for a new card together - plus they don't want to do that anyway. Couples set up a default split % for all of their shared expenses that they can adjust on a per transaction basis if they want. Users swipe which expenses they want to move from their private view to the couples shared view. Smoov keeps track of the total damage (who owes who how much) and whenever the couple is ready, they can settle up via direct ACH transfer through Smoov. Why? Modern couples who value their financial autonomy are getting married later in life, with more independent wealth and studies show they are fully merging their respective finances less and less - in a world where timing is everything, Smoov fits perfectly into that macro trend among others.

Cat’s Eye company has developed an AI-based audio-visual real-time violence detector that alerts the related school staff member in case it detects the occurrence of a bullying incident. The alert includes the exact location, number of people involved, and type of bullying. However, due to the sensitive nature of the matter and to ensure the privacy of students’ data the AI model has not been equipped with face-recognition technology so the identity of the students will remain anonymous. It is important to understand that many of the bullying incidents that escalate to an out-of-proportion degree could have been prevented if intervention took place during the earlier stages of the incident. However, the sad truth is that a large number of bullying incidents occur in very near proximity to a school staff member and go unnoticed. To put it simply, our mission is to prevent bullying incidents from occurring at schools. As such, what we value above all is the physical and mental safety of children at schools.

Mendle makes genome data analysis available and affordable. Genome analyses are the basis for most research and development projects in the life sciences. Genome data is used, for example, to study the effects of drug candidates in animal experiments in the pharmaceutical industry. Genome mapping is crucial for breeding new varieties in the seed industry, and in biotechnology for developing yeasts with new properties. Every day, thousands of genomes are sequenced worldwide. However, most of this data is difficult to find and usually only one aspect of the data is analysed. Analysing genome data means assigning a function to each individual letter in the genome. The difficulty is that genomes are up to 30 billion letters long but consist of only 4 different letters. And only about 1% of the letters in the genome contain important information like genes. Based on 20 years of genome research, we have developed a new, proprietary software, which we use in combination with a database of all the world's sequenced creatures to perform genome analyses with unprecedented quality and speed. Customers can have their own genomes analysed in service or use mendle, a Google-like search, to search our database for information that interests them.

Poemusart Logo
Poemusart
1-10
Jun 1, 2021
Poemusart is a first-of-its-kind platform for truly creative people to exhibit and monetize their work while providing real entertainment to the public and social engagement. Creators on Poemusart upload their poems, music, and art, then use our editor to digitally combine all three to create a new medium we call "Poemusart". This new combination a moving image, spoken poem and background music is a lot more entertaining. Creators on Poemusart can speak or write their poems in their own unique style on various topics, from current affairs to comedy, from short stories to inspirational messages. All are translatable into 21 spoken languages at the click of a button. Most people would not usually read a poem or scroll through art, but when poems, music, and art are combined, this new combination becomes a lot more entertaining. Creators on poemusart.com can speak or write their poems in their own unique style on various topics, from current affairs to comedy, from short stories to inspirational messages. All are translatable into 21 spoken languages at the click of a button. Users of poemusart.com are categorized as viewers, creators, and advertisers. Viewers can stream the algorithm-curated Poemusarts as entertainment and discuss it in the comments section. And advertisers display their brands on the website. Advertisers and users are also able to commission creators to create content for them in exchange for tokens. Viewers can also purchase a subscription. Subscription benefits include: creation of a playlist; skipping advertisements; use of the Text to Poem AI; and use of the Text to Art AI. On poemusart.com, "NFT" (non-fungible token) means that we endeavor to make sure that each poem, music, and art uploaded is not a duplicate of one that already exists on the site. It is not blockchain. It is very easy to use for everyone. We also make sure that each combination of poem, music, and art that constitutes a Poemusart is a one-of-a-kind combination. The primary purpose of the site is entertainment, similar to video streaming sites like TikTok.com. A Poemusart is like a video in that, when played, the viewer sees moving digital art and hears a spoken poem with music playing in the background. Creators and composers that contribute to the site are able to monetize their Poemusarts by receiving gifts in the form of tokens or through ownership transfers in exchange for tokens. The tokens on poemusart.com are similar to the tokens on Tiktok.com or the coins on Reddit.com; they are not crypto currency and only serve to lubricate gifts and exchanges on the site. The ownership transfer of a Poemusart is not the same as transactions on NFT platforms. Poemusarts cannot be downloaded from the site. There is no risk of your collection being stolen from the site. Also, on other social media sites like TikTok.com, there are many duplicates of the same videos or concepts. Users copy each other's content because they seek the benefits of having that particular video on their page. On poemusart.com, since we take strides to ensure that each Poemusart cannot be duplicated, the only way users can acquire other coveted Poemusarts is by transferring ownership in exchange for tokens. Benefits of ownership include increased traffic to the owner's collection, more attention, more discussions, more donations, and possible ad revenue sharing. Like the text-to-poem and text-to-art A.I. functions, the text-to-music A.I. function will allow users to simply type in certain keywords such as genre, styles, tempos, and moods into the text box, and the A.I. will generate a piece of music from that prompt.

Data is the world's most valuable resource and the backbone of the digital economy. However, data's full potential is actually not unlocked. Did you know that only 1% of the world's data is being analysed, while the rest remains untapped? Regulations around security, privacy, trust and ethics hinder access to enough valuable data for collaboration at scale. Syntheticus was founded in 2020 to unlock the power of data and protect privacy. The solution to that is synthetic data. Synthetic data is artificially generated and mimics the real-world data while preserving utility and privacy. In a nutshell: real-world data is collected, synthetic data is created. Synthetic data is poised to revolutionize the way the world democratizes access to data. Syntheticus leverages and orchestrates advanced Privacy-Enhancing Technologies such as Generative AI, Differential Privacy and Trusted Execution Environment (Confidential Computing). Syntheticus empowers customers to turn sensitive data from a liability into an asset by enabling them to share & monetize data and ML models in a privacy preserving way. The multi-type data orchestration platform provides seamless integrations with existing systems and maintains strong enterprise-grade data protection. Public and private organisations around the world trust Syntheticus to push the boundaries. Member of the ‘Nvidia Inception’ programs. ETH AI Center affiliated startup. IMD Competition Winner 2022.

Solomon Codes Logo
Solomon Codes
1-10
Jun 2021
"Solomon Codes" stands on three pillars: 1. Artificial Intelligence (natural language processing) - for the value creation 2. Tokenization - for the equitable value distribution between all contributors 3. Decentralization (DAO) - to make science fairly available globally. Our solution Solomon Codes is a fully automated and configurable scientific B2B SaaS platform. It is especially valuable for CEOs of small- or mid-sized companies in the worldwide chemical-, life- and computer science industries. In their jobs, they mostly depend on low-accuracy keyword searches conducted by a group of high-paid researchers. Our company offers an alternative that allows us to significantly increase the rate and value of any scientific research starting from the first search in the standard version or within five working days for a version configured by the Solomon Codes experts to a company or research-specific field of interest. In contrast to our competitors, our solution eliminates non-value adding market participants such as Elsevier, Springer, etc., by combining AI to enhance the customer's search results and tokenization for rewarding scientists (authors and reviewers). Like Spotify, the Solomon Codes improves the value for all parties participating on the platform by combining proven technologies in an industry ready for radical change. What Solomon Codes does: 1. Increasing venture flow for VCs through earlier insights on breakthrough scientific discoveries thanks to a fully configurable AI-powered semantic search 2. Increasing corporate profitability & competitiveness through better search result quality in less time, thanks to an AI-powered semantic search (NLP) 3. Equitable value distribution among all contributors: authors, reviewers, universities, businesses, thanks to tokenization 4. Fair & competitive pricing for universities from established and emerging countries in the scientific community

Current and currently planned BCIs are either very low resolution, unidirectional, or invasive - often all three. This greatly limits their therapeutic potential, let alone their use to enhance human capabilities or as an interface to simulated realities. TransAxon Ltd will revolutionise human use of computation, communications and AI through a technology pathway based on current and near-future neuro-engineering advances combined with deep learning algorithms. Our NZ-centred international team of experts in neuroscience and cognitive AI will solve the big problem of highly-augmentative BCIs, rapidly surpassing other nearer-term and less ambitious technologies and products.

Solomon Codes Logo
Solomon Codes
1-10
Jun 2021
"Solomon Codes" stands on three pillars: 1. Artificial Intelligence (natural language processing) - for the value creation 2. Tokenization - for the equitable value distribution between all contributors 3. Decentralization (DAO) - to make science fairly available globally. Our solution Solomon Codes is a fully automated and configurable scientific B2B SaaS platform. It is especially valuable for CEOs of small- or mid-sized companies in the worldwide chemical-, life- and computer science industries. In their jobs, they mostly depend on low-accuracy keyword searches conducted by a group of high-paid researchers. Our company offers an alternative that allows us to significantly increase the rate and value of any scientific research starting from the first search in the standard version or within five working days for a version configured by the Solomon Codes experts to a company or research-specific field of interest. In contrast to our competitors, our solution eliminates non-value adding market participants such as Elsevier, Springer, etc., by combining AI to enhance the customer's search results and tokenization for rewarding scientists (authors and reviewers). Like Spotify, the Solomon Codes improves the value for all parties participating on the platform by combining proven technologies in an industry ready for radical change. What Solomon Codes does: 1. Increasing venture flow for VCs through earlier insights on breakthrough scientific discoveries thanks to a fully configurable AI-powered semantic search 2. Increasing corporate profitability & competitiveness through better search result quality in less time, thanks to an AI-powered semantic search (NLP) 3. Equitable value distribution among all contributors: authors, reviewers, universities, businesses, thanks to tokenization 4. Fair & competitive pricing for universities from established and emerging countries in the scientific community

Jun 1, 2021
Weeki is a multi-platform, fully online SaaS (Software as a Service) application that provides a collaborative virtual whiteboard in the cloud. It was created to facilitate the exchange, collaboration and structuring of scientific information. Using Weeki, users such as professors, researchers and students can centralize their scientific content in an intuitive, customizable and secure visual space. The main objective of the application is to create theoretical or applied scientific models to solve technical-scientific problems. Weeki's virtual whiteboard provides an infinitely zoomable workspace, allowing users to represent and organize their ideas, concepts, thoughts, and data in a visual way. The application promotes collaboration by allowing users to share, brainstorm and work together on projects and thought patterns. The collaborative aspect of Weeki also allows users to exchange philosophical, business or human views, thus promoting the confrontation and mutual enrichment of ideas. The platform encourages the exchange of data and the evolution of knowledge by offering a massive and secure storage for the visualization of scientific data. Different types of objects can be added to the table, such as files, notes, shapes, diagrams, media, equations and bibliographic references. In addition, it is possible to include contact information for people, schools, laboratories and/or companies to establish a complete list of reference actors and stakeholders that could add value to the project. Weeki is a deeptech startup that integrates artificial intelligence to make the user experience more interactive and productive. The application uses AI features to optimize the organization of information, recommending to the user the right information and references (it goes on the web and recommends the right sources), allowing users to be more efficient and creative in their work. The interface is designed in a neuro-ergonomic way, offering a fun and ergonomic work experience. The information on the whiteboard is organized into different zones, which are in turn organized into several distinct layers. Weeki is much more than just an application. In addition to its collaborative virtual whiteboard, Weeki is also a marketplace, a place to exchange services and a training platform. It offers users the possibility to propose and participate in courses, creating a dynamic community of experts and learners. Thus, Weeki is positioned as a hub for users to meet and exchange ideas, providing a platform where they can not only collaborate on the virtual whiteboard, but also expand their knowledge by participating in courses and benefiting from the expertise of other users. This combination of features makes Weeki not only a working tool, but also a dynamic space where the community can grow and enrich each other. On Weeki, users have the freedom to create their own templates or courses that they can then sell to other users. At the same time, they can also participate in templates and courses proposed by other users. This interaction between members of the community helps to foster exchanges, encourage meetings and stimulate collaborative work. In a nutshell, Weeki is an innovative online application that offers a collaborative virtual whiteboard in the cloud, designed for professionals and students in the scientific field. It aims to facilitate the exchange, collaboration and organization of scientific information, while promoting creativity and efficiency through artificial intelligence features.

With just a single video recording, Gan.ai allows brands to generate hundreds, thousands, or millions of personalized copies of it with variables changed in the voice and lip-sync as if it was personally recorded for each viewer. Our AI lip-syncs & voice-sync models templatize specified parts of a video in real time and deliver it to users natively across platforms. Enterprise brands like Samsung, Zomato, vivo, and Swiggy uses Gan.ai to run hyper-personal video campaigns with celebrities, leaders, and other stakeholders, calling out users' names, locations, order items, nearby stores, etc— maximizing CTRs, ROI & impact of campaigns. Whether it’s email, SMS, social media, WhatsApp, pre-roll ads, IPTV, mobile apps, personalized checkout, landing pages, or anything brands require, Gan.ai integrates with it. Before Gan.ai, brands could only make personalized text-based campaigns, inserting the name of the user in an email or SMS, or at best as a text graphic inside a video. With Gan.ai, the name of the user (and other variables) can be spoken out by the actor in the video, leading to much higher engagement, conversions, click-through rates, and brand recall for brands in their marketing campaigns.

Air AI is a software company specializing in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP.) Our vision is to improve rental and sales transactions with AI by providing a multi-lingual rental/sales listings site.

We also automatically translate into the language of the users region, based on GPS of the phone. We're also developing an in-App video feature. We use proprietary algorithms and machine learning to recognize specific buildings, vehicles, and yachts in a video feed from our App, so users can scan the skyline of their city with their smartphone and our iOS/Android App can recognize buildings, cars, and boats and will offer them listings to rent/buy.

Dec 1, 2021
Lightpaper: https://api-verse.com/litepaper The API-Verse as a platform has the main goal of simplifying the development of all the blockchain-based projects present in our ecosystem using state of the art data analytics and artificial intelligence. It is a comprehensive solution that significantly reduces the cost of entry into the blockchain, Web3, and Defi market by providing data in a way that is familiar to developers that have not yet found themselves interacting with the world of blockchain technology. For projects that already have experience in extracting and analyzing blockchain data, it provides access to a quick and costless way of gathering that data, allowing them to focus on solving business problems rather than working on the supporting infrastructure, which tends to consume a lot of project resources and delay the implementation of core functions. It’s crucial to note that the API-Verse allows access to not only real-time data but also historical data, making it very easy to spot trends, bottoms, peaks, cyclic movements and other community behaviors that would otherwise require a heavy amount of research to outline. Our API-Verse consists of several interconnected solutions that together provide multiple comprehensive solutions to common and uncommon business problems. These solutions are a combination of a JSON-RPC API (own nodes), storage analysers, blockchain indexers, front-end SDK, a relayer mechanism, and a validator. The indexer allows you to access and analyze on-chain data that was previously only available in a difficult-to-access way (or sometimes even impossible to obtain) and directly answer business questions and needs. The combination of the indexer and relayer allows not only to effectively detect abnormal behaviours but also to react quickly if those behaviours aren’t in line with your project guidelines, meaning that the analysis of the data won’t only provide you with new business opportunities, it will also potentially protect against malicious attacks from third parties, or, more commonly, from bots. The relayer also allows to automate the execution of cyclic activities that previously required either manual execution or the private key storage of the activity followed by the need of performing operations directly from the application backend. In conclusion, API-Verse is a comprehensive platform that provides a cost-effective and straightforward solution for businesses looking to enter the blockchain market. With its powerful range of solutions, businesses can easily access real-time and historical blockchain data, detect abnormal behaviors, and automate cyclic activities. These features make API-Verse an essential tool for businesses looking to gain a competitive edge in the blockchain market.

ALPHS Logo
ALPHS
11-50
Nov 15, 2021
ALPHS is a fast-growing privately held organization with a business valuation of $7 million as of 2023, Forbes estimated. The inspirational success story of the empire redirects to Ashini Gogoi, an ex-Meta employee, who haphazardly started it as a lifestyle community on Instagram in January 2021 as per an investigation by CNN—Forbes declared that he is a young yet enigmatic self-made CEO. Following his vision in August 2020, Ashini managed to take a loan capital of US$40,000 from his friends and family, his company started making headlines in major publications for the first time in November 2022, when the company signed a contract with the American rapper, Wiz Khalifa. The company is listed as a high-profile organization on Crunchbase and is actively offering its services in Tier 1 countries as of 2023—a statistical analysis showed that 87% of its customer base is women from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy. The company's website gets active during major festivals only and consumers can purchase for a limited duration of seven days, hence selling out very quickly—their most affordable models that hold their value start between $850 and $1,200. "ALPHS Inc. is one of the most secretive young companies in corporate history next to the giant Rolex," says the American business newspaper, The Wall Street Journal. Reports suggest that Ashini took down several notable articles including Forbes, CNN, WSJ—while his organization was under suspicion by April 2023—the company claimed that their products were meticulously made and they had consistently maintained their values. The company has drawn criticism from multiple sources, with questions raised about its secretive nature, and faced numerous allegations on whether their business was legal—including a handful of law firms in the financial investigation—a rigorous background check was done which publicized that they operate as an online retailer—with the approval of the Jewelers Vigilance Committee—the materials used by the company were declared legitimate in October 2022. The company also produces high-quality films titled, "Inspired by best-selling novels" for customer retention and is investing enormous funds in the development of artificial intelligence. ALPHS headquarters were officially shifted from Hyderabad, India to Milan, Italy in March 2023 under the guidance of Y Combinator, the lead investor of the company. As of 2023, the company has reportedly signed agreements with eleven prominent stars and models for endorsing its products.

To help set companies on the path to net zero emissions, TREEO provides them with accurate and traceable data about our high-quality, nature-based Carbon Dioxide Removals (CDRs) while we empower tree growers through the TREEO Technology and access to the carbon market. The TREEO carbon product can be split into two main steps: carbon capture and carbon storage. Trees capture CO2 from our atmosphere and store it as carbon while releasing the oxygen we breathe. Through the TREEO technology, we empower tree growers in the Global South and finance reforestation and restoration projects. We then guarantee the carbon is stored in the long term with harvested wood products and biochar. TREEO guarantees full transparency through our single-tree monitoring technology. Solving the climate crisis requires scalable and inclusive carbon removal solutions. For millions of smallholder farmers, climate finance is currently inaccessible. To monetize their carbon removals, they need reliable and easy-to-use monitoring technologies, required for transparency and trust. It is our mission to provide farmers with exactly that: A single-tree monitoring technology, empowering local communities to generate verified carbon removals and connecting them to the global carbon market. With these partnerships and the TREEO Technology, we can then provide companies transparent CDRs to live up to their corporate responsibility with the data to prove their impact.

Greenitio

Nov 1, 2021
Greenitio is transforming the industry with its AI-driven platform technology to produce functional biopolymers from abundant natural resources as a sustainable alternative to petrochemical polymers, all while preserving their inherent bioactivity and functions. Although natural biopolymers like plant proteins and polysaccharides can replace certain synthetic polymers, in most cases, there's a scarcity of high-performance biopolymers with properties like oil-soluble, water-resistant, flexible, strength, etc and options that meet the required specifications are rare. Few candidates derived from bio-based monomers or chemical processes using natural small molecules fulfil these criteria, but their production often compromises bioactivity and biodegradability. In traditional chemistry, functionalizing biomacromolecules into useful biopolymers has been a complex challenge, often leading to low yields and high costs when balancing performance and bioactivity. However, Greenitio's innovative technology overcomes these hurdles by implementing a biogenic process. This groundbreaking approach converts low-value, underperforming biomacromolecules into high-value, high-performance functional biopolymers sustainably and affordably—previously deemed unattainable. Remarkably, Greenitio's methodology not only preserves but enhances the natural bioactivity of biomacromolecules, unlocking the boundless potential for innovation and possibilities. Our biopolymers offer superior bioactivity and health benefits that surpass synthetic alternatives. Competing technologies only prioritize performance. We proudly offer a rare combination of performance and bioactivity at an affordable price.

We’re creating affordable next generation artificial limbs to enhance human capacities. Our first product, the biogrip arm, is an artificial limb that helps people with arm amputations to be independent again, recovering high-precision mobility within minutes, and allowing people to self-assemble the arm even when they have lost both limbs. To make this possible, We have created a concept of a socket worn as a glove that provides comfort, flexibility and easy adjustment. We want to change the fact that there is an 80% of prosthesis rejection because (in their own words) “they make them feel disabled”. Our dream is to provide not only physical rehabilitation but social and emotional recovery . We are offering real independence, and empowerment of people to promote a world without limitations.

Moving beyond Robotic Processes Automation, companies want systems that can reason to replace and augment human decision-making. But they don't want to trust Black Box systems like those built on deep learning. They want systems that are transparent, can explain themselves, and whose workings and processes can be audited. This is the age of Knowledge graphs Like all new technology they have roots deep in the past: our founder, Dr Andy, worked on his first Knowledge graph in 1998. But new developments in Graph Databases and cloud computing have made Knowledge Graphs a practical reality. We've decided that ThinkBase is our future, so we've made all the different elements of the DARL ecosystem available in a single Knowledge Graph model. With ThinkBase you can: Integrate your organization's specialized knowledge of the structures and relationships that make up your business. Weaponize that by building in Fuzzy expert system rules to make it an active reasoning engine Use common sense reasoning to make inferences and perform sanity checks. Communicate with your reasoning engine using a fully configurable ChatBot front end.

Price movement is often used as the primary indication to showcase the success of cryptocurrencies. While most blockchain enthusiasts understand that a project is a lot more than price action, none of the current platforms help users understand the real innovation behind web3. There is a clear need to help companies & individuals understand what is really happening behind the scenes of projects & ecosystems. We believe Web3 is the future of the way people interact with the digital world. Believing in this future is one thing, but finding the projects that drive the innovations needed to make this a reality can be a real struggle. Which project are actually valuable? Are the bold statements made on social media the truth? By making the information easily accessible and searchable in a human friendly way, Hallar aims to close the gap between the hype and ground truth of projects building on Web 3 technology.

Today, millions of companies around the world are teaching almost 400M frontline workers to communicate with customers using outdated technology. Usually, this is face-to-face roleplaying with a coach, mentor, or supervisor. The online training alternative is scalable but doesn't develop practical communication skills, on top of being tedious. Quality of customer communications directly affects business performance, and companies spend hundreds of billions of dollars on this type of face-to-face training. But this is expensive, inconsistent in quality, requires human resources and training schedules. We've digitalized this type of training. CanSay is a learning tool for creating interactive speech simulations with an AI companion, enabling effective and practical communication skills training and focusing on frontline workers within various sectors to increase sales and client satisfaction. CanSay simulations efficiently build up skills with speaking practice. They are involving, available anytime/anywhere, do not require human resources and can be fully managed in any corporate LMS.

An AI based mobile app that tells users how to separate and treat their waste within their neighborhoods. Our goal is to have people separate all 7 types of plastics, but until the infrastructure/machinery is ready to process that, we will focus on general waste (e.g. cans, glass, cardboard, e-waste) so we can start right now. It’s a platform where users sort plastics and upload data (and get rewarded), and where companies can do (green) sponsoring/promotions and offset their plastic production.

Nov 1, 2021
Balanced News Summary is a news source self-funded and created by an independent Australian researcher – we are not backed by any large companies or investors. The purpose of our website is to provide clarity and reunite communities, by identifying bias and offering equal analysis from both sides of the political spectrum. By presenting multiple perspectives from different publications, and by rating the bias of different news sources, Balanced News Summary frees people from 'filter bubbles' and algorithmic 'feedback loops' created by modern day technology. We believe this will result in readers becoming well informed on trending news, as well as becoming more open-minded towards conflicting opinions. Balanced News Summary uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to generate content 24/7, aggregated from multiple sources across the political spectrum. The founder has also created 4,000 posts dating back to 2007. We offer multiple perspectives on the political spectrum for each particular topic, so that you can read both sides and form your own opinion! We also offer 'quick read' news summaries to get you up to date with the news quickly and conveniently. We are big advocates for freedom of speech! Our services are available on the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or you can visit our website.

QuickFunds

Oct 6, 2021
Soon to be opened! We offer an online platform that provides a revolutionary solution for traders seeking capital to finance their trading activities. With an innovative approach, we offer traders the opportunity to take on challenging 'challenges', where they must achieve a predetermined return with a DEMO account (fake money account) without losing a fixed percentage of their capital. This provides traders with the opportunity to demonstrate their trading skills. One of the unique features of our platform is the use of demo accounts with 'fake money' during the execution of challenges. This allows traders to demonstrate their trading strategies to us without any capital risk. One of the key aspects of our platform is the advanced risk management system that is applied. By utilizing artificial intelligence and advanced analytics techniques, we can closely monitor traders' trading behavior and minimize risks. This ensures that only the most profitable traders are selected and supported, allowing the platform to provide a high return to investors. For profitable traders, we offer an attractive profit-sharing arrangement (70/30), allowing traders to retain a large portion of their profits. This ensures a fair and transparent collaboration between us and the traders, benefiting both parties from the platform's success. Overall, we offer an innovative and lucrative platform for traders to finance and grow their trading activities. With a combination of challenging challenges, advanced risk management techniques, and attractive profit-sharing, we are the ideal choice for traders seeking capital. We offer a trading platform of both DXTrader and CTrader for trader flexibility; since 03-01-2024, the largest (Metatrader) no longer supports Prop Firms; existing Prop Firms are actively transitioning, which presents the perfect opportunity to enter the market. Once the budget goal is reached, we will be active in the market within 4 months, after the AI system is built, a website is developed, and a suitable team with experience in customer service and profitable trading is selected. We expect to quickly build trust and capture a strong market position, partly due to the aforementioned halt of MetaTrader for Prop Firms. Well-known Prop Firms receive an average of 30 orders per day for DEMO accounts to qualify for a Funded account; this target audience is broad and always looking for an improved alternative that we can provide.
