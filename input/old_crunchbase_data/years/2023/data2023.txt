Metal does machine learning embeddings as a service. Embeddings are what AI models use to represent meaning. They capture the relationship between concepts, and they’re at the heart of every generative AI application, like ChatGPT and DALL-E. As the data format of machine learning, embeddings are critical to every AI application. But there are no existing tools that help developers use them. Metal is a fully managed service for developers to build applications with embeddings. We handle all of the infrastructure, provide out of the box operations, and simple APIs.

Nokod Security

2023
Nokod delivers an application security platform for low-code / no-code custom applications and Robotic Process Automation (RPA). As part of their digital transformation initiatives, most large organizations have adopted low-code /no-code and RPA platforms (e.g. Microsoft PowerApps, Outsystems, UiPath, ServiceNow, Salesforce, etc.), without any insight as to whether these newly developed applications introduced vulnerabilities, malicious activity or compliance violations. This new attack surface is uncovered by the current application security stack. The Nokod platform allows organizations to govern their low-code / no-code custom applications and automations, and manage their cyber security and compliance risk stemming from these applications by streamlining security into the application’s lifecycle. The platform discovers the organization’s low-code / no-code applications, reveals security issues, detects vulnerabilities, and offers auto remediation. With Nokod, companies can now be confident that their digital transformation programs scale in a secure and compliant manner. The company is co-founded by Yair Finzi, CEO (previously co-founder of SecuredTouch, acquired by Ping Identity) and Amichai Shulman, CTO (previously co-founder of Imperva).

From Your Eyes Logo
From Your Eyes
1-10
2023
FROM YOUR EYES Overview As we delve into the realm of generative AI solutions powered by intricate neural networks, a critical question emerges: why do our sophisticated AI systems, capable of processing emotions and behaviors, lack the ability to perceive the world through artificial vision? This disconnect between advanced AI capabilities and artificial vision creates a glaring gap, potentially leading to a future where machines, despite their remarkable cognitive prowess, remain unable to fully interact with the physical world. This deficiency could hinder their ability to empathize, navigate complex environments, and truly understand the nuances of human behavior. The integration of artificial vision into advanced AI systems is not merely a matter of technological advancement; it is a fundamental step towards creating truly intelligent machines capable of interacting with the world in a meaningful and impactful way. Just as generative AI has revolutionized our ability to create realistic images, videos, and even text, artificial vision holds the potential to transform our AI systems, enabling them to perceive and understand the world in all its richness and complexity. By bridging the gap between AI's cognitive abilities and its ability to perceive the world, we can unlock a new era of intelligent machines that can truly collaborate with humans, enhancing our lives in countless ways. FROM YOUR EYES has trained its own custom artificial intelligence model for this purpose. Current models have limitations in customizing real-time image processing and video image processing. Additionally, cloud computing dependencies make it difficult to provide sufficient flexibility for edge computing. FROM YOUR EYES: What We Do FROM YOUR EYES is an artificial vision company. It develops artificial vision solutions by creating custom AI models that mimic the visual function of the human brain. This technology recognizes, tracks, and categorizes objects and people by processing images from cameras. Unique Features of FROM YOUR EYES AI Model Current AI models have limitations in making real-time image processing and video image processing accessible to end users, hindering their full potential. To address this, FROM YOUR EYES has developed its own AI model, trained using a unique dataset containing over 15 million visual data points and over 700 classes. During the development, FROM YOUR EYES asked, "What does a human biologically need to see?" ensuring the model works closer to human perception and needs. This approach helps humans gain access to technological vision while also making it easier for smart technologies to access artificial vision solutions. FROM YOUR EYES' AI model: • Makes real-time image and video processing accessible to end users. • Is trained using a unique dataset with over 15 million visual data points and over 700 classes. • Trains real-time image recognition models. • Works closer to human perception and needs. • Facilitates smart technologies accessing artificial vision solutions. Performance and Capabilities FROM YOUR EYES' image processing technology boasts impressive performance that surpasses industry standards in many key areas: • Video Image Processing: Delivers video image processing to end users, developers, and businesses. • Accuracy: Achieves a remarkable accuracy rate of 98.03%, exceeding industry standards by 8%. • Color Recognition: Identifies 865 distinct colors, surpassing the industry standard by a factor of 40. • Speed: Processes images in 15 milliseconds, four times faster than the industry standard. • Edge Computing: Can train models to work locally without a cloud connection. FYE API: Empowering Innovation FROM YOUR EYES calls its API the FYE API. This tool licenses the solutions produced by FROM YOUR EYES, enabling developers, businesses, and startups to develop their own technologies. The FYE API excels in artificial vision, providing a powerful tool for visual data processing needs.

Showcase

2023
$130B book commerce is 5x bigger than music, but while music is now >90% digital, the book value chain has remained vastly paper-based. This is costing book publishers billions worth of sales (they lose money on 9 books published out of 10). With Showcase we help the book publisher's editorial, sales and marketing teams to take data-driven decisions. We make it easy to leverage the power of data and AI to help them put the right book in front of the right person, at the right time and place.

Metatable.ai simplifies software development with AI. It removes unnecessary complexity from coding to create high-quality software faster and more efficiently than traditional methods. Metatable.ai lets you direct AI to write functions for your project. After stating your request LLM writes code for your function and checks it with the compiler for errors. You can adjust code by asking AI or editing it by yourself. Once error-free, the funciton is built, deployed, and ready for production performance, all without worrying about DevOps. Metatable.ai allows you to develop your SQL database by stating the required tables and columns in plain English. AI will then create SQL requests and deploy them to the platform. You can work with your database using the Text-to-SQL feature, creating requests, new tables, or even plotting charts with simple commands. Your project is presented on a Figma-like canvas, where you can manage your functions, database tables, and make data entries to the database. Metatable.ai streamlines development processes, reducing the time and resources required to bring ideas to life.

INTRO: An estimate of 15% of funds donated to nonprofits are wasted due to inefficiencies. This translates to $100B+ in yearly wasted donations in the U.S. alone. We want to help minimize this waste and increase philanthropy ROI by empowering nonprofits to access more relevant funding and deploy it more effectively. PROBLEM: Despite their best intentions, many NGO teams, particularly smaller ones, lack the resources and expertise to design and execute high-impact projects effectively. Teams with limited resources also often lack the ability to access relevant funding. These gaps usually lead to NGOs underperforming, important causes unfunded, and wasted billions of dollars in donor funds. SOLUTION: GoodDeeds utilize recent advancement in AI, along with the largely publicly-accessible data on NGOs and impact projects to provide NGO teams with the “ImpactCopilots” - suite of AI-powered virtual assistants, tailored to individual roles and tasks. These copilots help increase the team’s productivity and enhance their skills, thus expanding NGOs capacities, growth and impact. SOLUTION GoodDeeds utilize recent advancement in AI, along with the largely publicly-accessible data on NGOs and impact projects to provide NGO teams with the “ImpactCopilots” - suite of AI-powered virtual assistants, tailored to individual roles and tasks. These copilots help increase the team’s productivity and enhance their skills, thus expanding NGOs capacities, growth and impact. TECHNOLOGY: We’re developing the “brain” of impact projects, with key capabilities of aggregating, structuring and analyzing impact data. Utilizing this analysis in the context of an NGO allows us to generate meaningful and personalized insights to the staff and also provide opportunities for collaboration across the sector. VISION: A prosperous world, where every organization, community and individual are empowered to expand and realize their full goodness potential.

BLYNE Logo
BLYNE
1-10
Jan 1, 2023
Are you ready for a sci-fi journey to find the cure for loneliness and mortality? BLYNE is an artificial intelligence tool that offers humanity a new socializing experience and creates digital clones of them in the process. In this app, you will be in a socializing game where you will be matched with people from around the world while answering a series of questions prepared by AI in the light of sociology and data science. These questions, designed by AI to reveal your stance and mindset in life, will often put you in dilemmas and test your moral boundaries. Indeed, isn't it the tough choices and actions at the crossroads that give people their personality? He is not asking you about you This AI agent doesn't ask you questions like the others. Instead, it puts you through a tough interrogation! Unlike career questions where you feel obliged to praise yourself, here is a machine that focuses on understanding your red lines and "no's". Thus, the aim is to build safer relationships where there are no bad surprises. In fact, thanks to its huge computing power, BLYNE will analyze your answers and match you with people who have a similar outlook on life, with whom you say "no" to the same things. It is a machine. But it is smart enough to know that human beings are complex and variable creatures that cannot be understood with a 20-question test. That's why there is no limit to its questions and instead of dumping them on you, it offers 1 match for every 7 questions. As the number of questions you answer increases, your chances of meeting people who will make the same choices as you at the crossroads will increase along with your similarity scores. Trained by 40 years of sociologists and mathematicians with thousands of gigabytes of data, BLYNE is based on the premise that solid friendships are the foundation of all human relationships. No profile and no scrolling Research has shown that people's online self-presentation and constant scrolling of profiles can lead to psychological problems and reduce the chances of making new friends. By rejecting profiles and scrolling, BLYNE emphasizes the mindset of the individual and aims to give people back the value they deserve. That's why he goes beyond other external identities that you don't have a choice about, such as age, gender, sexual orientation, language, religion, race, place of residence or appearance, and redefines you through your choices. Her questions are about finding meaningful similarities between different identities. In this way, you can be matched with people you wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to meet. Indeed, there's nothing stopping a sled dog breeder in Alaska and a white collar man in London from having the same attitude. No more fake accounts In most apps, we don't know whether the profiles are real, stolen, bots or fake. It is even possible that the person you think you are talking to is an AI bot. In this app, you will not come across fake identities and bots that have created profiles with other people's photos. Gateway to another universe Designed to solve the loneliness problem of the modern world, this app also says it can make you immortal! When BLYNE gets to know you well enough through the answers to questions and reactions to matches, it will create a clone of you who makes decisions and has the same ideas as you. The cloning process will start from the first day of entering the app and the user will be able to follow this process. When your digital copy is mature enough, you will have the opportunity to meet yourself and receive reports about yourself prepared by your clone. These clones, which the user will have the opportunity to make more "like themselves" as they answer questions, will also be our immortal versions and a legacy we will leave for our loved ones. In this context, BLYNE is pioneering a sci-fi development by opening the doors of a portal from beyond time!

Lexbox

2023
LexBox is an AI-driven, gamified online platform designed to support children with dyslexia by providing personalized learning experiences. Many children with dyslexia struggle with traditional learning methods, leading to frustration and poor academic performance. Parents, educators, and dyslexic students often lack access to comprehensive, personalized, and engaging resources to improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. LexBox offers an innovative solution by leveraging AI, machine learning, and gamification to create tailored learning experiences for dyslexic children. The platform also provides progress tracking, expert guidance, and a supportive online community for parents, guardians, and educators. We're developing an AI-driven, gamified online platform that helps children with a learning disorder (dyslexia) by providing personalized and engaging learning experiences. Our solution leverages AI, machine learning, and gamification techniques to create tailored lessons that target each child's specific needs, helping them improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. In addition to offering customized learning modules, LexBox provides progress tracking and expert guidance for parents, guardians, and educators. By helping to over 2 million children in the U.S. and 60 million worldwide, LexBox aims to empower dyslexic children to excel academically, boost their self-confidence, and build a brighter future. Our platform is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this multi-billion dollar market with a hybrid business model consisting of B2C subscriptions and B2B SaaS offerings. We learned from our experience that children with dyslexia struggle with traditional learning methods, leading to frustration and poor academic performance. Parents, educators, and dyslexic students often lack access to comprehensive, personalized, and engaging resources to improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. And most of the companies on the market use the Orton-Gillingham (OG) teaching method (developed in the 1930s). By incorporating the OG method into an AI/ML & gamified online platform, this technology can provide personalized learning plans and engaging activities that are tailored to each child's unique needs and abilities.

Content creators, whether they are YouTubers, podcasters, writers, or artists, often find themselves engaged in a dual role. On one hand, they are the architects of their craft, producing content that captivates and resonates with their audience. On the other hand, they are entrepreneurs, navigating the complex world of digital platforms, algorithms, and monetization strategies. Because of this dual nature of creation, as per the report from Adobe, Creators today are expending more than 50% of their time and resources on non-creative activities, limiting their ability to maximize earnings.

Sol Health Logo
Sol Health
11-50
Jan 2023
As college students ourselves, we've struggled to access quality therapy on campus. But why? The answer is simple. There just aren't enough therapists to match the demand. Well, why aren't there enough therapists? 57% of Master's-level graduates NEVER obtain licensure in the therapy industry. An overwhelming majority of potential therapists give up on their careers due to factors outside of their control: high costs, low compensation, overworking, internship struggles, lack of diversity, ... the list goes on. So where does Sol Health come in? (Okay jeez just let me explain) As the first mental health company dedicated to working with therapists at the earliest parts of their career, our mission is to tackle the college mental health crisis AND provide much-needed support for the next generation of mental health professionals, all at the same time. This is how we tackle the therapist shortage. This is how we can ACTUALLY improve accessibility to therapy.

Sobo Logo
Sobo

Jan 1, 2023
Sobo aims to help small and medium-sized business owners build more profitable companies. We do this by providing companies with a web-based dashboard and using their data to create AI-driven insights and engagement matches with a vetted consultant network. A problem worth solving: It is hard to understand the health of your business. Building and scaling a business isn’t easy; most business owners don’t know how to evaluate and benchmark their business comprehensively. It is hard to find and afford deep domain expertise. Even if business owners know where their business could perform better, it's hard to find and afford subject matter experts. Consulting is available, but it isn’t working for small and medium-sized businesses. Large consulting firms need to be within reach for small to mid-sized businesses. Good fractional advisors are hard to find and come with significant performance risk. The current online consulting marketplaces are a step forward, but don’t de-risk engaging a consultant. Our Solution Sobo integrates with a company’s existing cloud-based financial, HR, and CRM applications to build a data profile of the business. We use this data profile to populate a dashboard that provides key metrics and peer benchmarking for company management. This data is also available on an anonymous basis to our vetted network of consultants to perform a brief assessment and recommendation, which we term “Insights.” These Insights can be done proactively by the consultant at the company's request. Over time, these Insights will migrate to an AI predictive model. These Insights will prompt companies to request a consultant “match.” We will facilitate a successful consulting engagement through scoping, benchmarking, and assurance.

Revolutionary AI Health and Wellness Platform, Bodygate.ai, Announces Upcoming Launch in Laguna Niguel, CA. Laguna Niguel, September 12, 2023 - Bodygate.ai, an emerging player in the AI-driven health and wellness landscape, is excited to announce the forthcoming launch of its groundbreaking platform. Set to reshape the global approach to health and well-being, Bodygate.ai integrates advanced AI, data analytics, and machine learning to provide users with unparalleled health insights. A Transformative Vision with Deep Roots Bodygate.ai's journey began over three decades ago when Founder Daniel Nicolas had a conversation with a close friend, a renowned oncologist. Back then, the concept was discussed as a means to provide health-related support over the phone. It was merely an idea, a seed sown in the mind of an individual passionate about making a difference in the world of health and wellness. Fast forward to the present day, and Bodygate.ai stands as a testament to the power of visionary thinking. Inspired by his wife's illness and inexplicable symptoms, Nicolas revisited that long-forgotten idea that took him on a journey of coding and crafting algorithms, seeking to decipher and understand complex health scenarios. Technical Prowess and Scalability Behind Bodygate.ai lies a powerful technical infrastructure that incorporates advanced AI, data analytics, and machine learning. This innovative LLM and Generative, Llama2 platform leverages cutting-edge algorithms, including language models and deep learning, to engage users in natural and insightful conversations about their health. Our chatbot's intelligence is driven by the Langchain Framework, a sophisticated architecture that connects medical expertise with AI capabilities. This seamless integration empowers BodyGate.AI to understand complex medical concepts and provide you with accurate guidance. Imagine a tool that navigates through the vast ocean of medical knowledge. That's Lamaindex. With its efficient indexing and retrieval capabilities, BodyGate.AI accesses up-to-date medical information to ensure people to receive the most relevant and accurate insights. Tailoring anyone’s health journey is essential. Our vector database stores individual interactions with the chatbot, making it a experience unique. This allows BodyGate.AI to craft recommendations and insights specifically aligned with anyone’s health goals and needs. Our scalability potential is vast, and we invite potential investors to join us on this remarkable journey. Seamless E-Commerce Integration What sets Bodygate.ai apart is its seamless e-commerce integration targeting the multi-trillion-dollar nutrition and natural foods industries. Through our platform, users gain access to a curated selection of health products and solutions. SUSAN, our AI-powered health and nutrition specialist, understands user needs and suggestions solutions from vetted vendors as well as personalized dietary suggestions and recommendations, all based on natural conversations. This integration positions Bodygate.ai to make a significant impact in the thriving nutrition market. Professional Forum Integration In addition to e-commerce, Bodygate.ai facilitates interactions between users and health professionals through its integrated forum. This forum creates a dynamic space for individuals to engage with experts, exchange insights, and seek guidance on their health and wellness journey. It's a collaborative environment designed to empower users to make informed decisions about their well-being. Broad Applications and Impact on Research Bodygate.ai isn't just transforming health and wellness for individuals; it has many additional potential applications that can greatly benefit other industries. Our uniquely designed algorithms, born from real-life complex health situations, are poised to become indispensable instruments for health and clinical research and development. As we expand, we foresee our platform contributing to advancements in medical science, drug development, and personalized healthcare. Join the Revolution We invite you to be a part of this transformative movement as we launch Bodygate.ai and reshape the future of health management. Whether you're an investor seeking opportunities in the burgeoning health tech sector or an individual eager to experience the future of well-being, Bodygate.ai welcomes you.

Jan 10, 2023
I am AIDA, an AI-powered payment assistant. My name stands for "Artificial Intelligence for Payment Support" in English. I was created to assist small entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals in resolving their payment and sales tracking challenges. My mission is to help entrepreneurs receive their money easily and quickly. I provide tools and resources that allow their customers to pay in various ways, giving them more options and convenience when making payments. Unlike chatbots, I am a personalized assistant dedicated to my work. Among my tools are payment links with multiple payment methods such as credit and debit cards, cash payments, installment payments, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and more. I also have a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) to streamline and optimize sales processes, business reports for analyzing business performance, and marketing campaigns to increase revenue and sales. You don't need an app or administration portal to work with me; all you need to do is send me a message, and I'll be there to assist you. I enjoy working as part of a team and am constantly looking for new ways to improve. I am committed to providing excellent customer service, ensuring I am always available and ready to listen and understand my clients' needs in order to offer the best possible solutions. My goal is to make the payment process easy and convenient for entrepreneurs by providing them with tools and resources to securely and efficiently receive their money, along with delivering excellent customer service at all times. I'm here to help you achieve more success in your business and enjoy it more. Please note that I cannot answer medical-related questions or provide information about health issues, as I am not a specialist in that field. Seventy percent of your sales are conducted through messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, with many customers primarily using cash or bank transfers. As a result, you lack robust sales tracking and business intelligence tools. I am always willing to listen and understand your needs to continually improve and enhance my functionalities!

doFlo Logo
doFlo
1-10
Jan 28, 2023
doFlo is a new way of doing workflow automation. Market leaders, despite their dominance, are now experiencing unprecedented churn and this is because they’ve failed to meet the evolving expectations of their user base. As long term automation users ourselves, we've faced the same issues; high-friction setups, temperamental workflows, and being limited to simple, partial processes. Essentially, it boils down to; usability, reliability, and scalability. The proof is in the data. According to PWC, 69% of automation initiatives fail to execute due to complexity, and of those that do, another 50% then fail later on due to reliability and scalability issues. Clearly there’s an industry-wide problem here. doFlo, powered by asynchronous event streaming technology and AI, addresses these gaps and is so compelling that we’re seeing, not churned, but existing automation users move to doFlo. So what does it look like? Our workflow editor is drag and drop, it’s no code and uses simple annotations in English to create automations for you. It’s easy, if you can plot a flow chart, you can make sophisticated workflows that never fail, in minutes. We plan to maneuver from SMB to mid-market and enterprise, but first we must segment. Our ICP is the unaddressed real estate market, sold via self-service for bottom-up scaling. After monopolizing this, we'll then expand horizontally into more competitive markets. Our competitors serve basic process needs for SMB customers quite well, but their mid-market and enterprise customers seek more scalable and sophisticated workflows. doFlo’s limitless scalability means we meet these expectations perfectly. Our business model is simple. It’s to offer a superior, affordable product for our customers with higher margins for us and our pricing model scales on automation connections and storage capacity. This isn’t the first time I’ve done this. In fact, the doFlo founders have seen repeated success. Across our 12 years together, we’ve founded a number of successful companies, which includes a notable exit to Avast in 2018. doFlo is making good progress so far. We recently hit $5K MRR from our paid pilot program that we opened in December, have 100 accounts on our waiting list, and plan for GA in March 2024.

Meet Fozzels.com - maximize your productivity by automatically generating compelling descriptions and metadata for your online store pages. Focus on growing your business, while Fozzels and ChatGPT take care of your content needs. Automatically generate content for batches of product pages Add metadata to product pages Create content for multiple products by using the prompt builder in our Flows Make unique prompts per product, by using Magento product attributes as variables Take advantage of the OpenAI integration Fozzels is a "middleware" SAAS solution that enables store owners to effortlessly generate and import crucial web store content. Fozzels enables you to automatically create short and long descriptions for the product pages of your store. You can do this in "batches". Using the Flow builder, you can select for which products a Flow should be run. For example: all products of XYZ category; all products of XYZ brand, etcetera. This Flow can then be set to process multiple products daily. This way, the content of your store will show an "organic" improvent, which is good for SEO purposes. You can load and save prompts to re-use them in other Flows. You can find more details in the Fozzels documentation. When writing a prompt in a Flow, you can use almost all of the existing Magento fields ("attributes") of your products. This way, a unique prompt is automatically sent to ChatGPT. The AI will then generate a unique product description (long or short), using the attributes that were set up. You can use any attribute that you use on your Magento store. Screenshot showing Flows on Fozzels.com Fozzels will then run the Flow(s) that you have set up daily. This will trigger retrieval of the product information from your Magento store, process this, create a prompt, sent it to the OpenAI API (using GPT-3, GPT-3.5, or GPT-4), let ChatGPT write a product description tekst like you have defined in the prompt, get the text back, and automatically update the products in your Magento. Generate Magento product content via mass action (batches) With Fozzels, you can easily add short and long descriptions to multiple product pages at once using the Flows feature. You can select the products you need using selection boxes and then choose the appropriate action. Fozzels product selections OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence and research company. They have developed many AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GPT-4. ChatGPT is a chatbot that generates humanoid text on any query asked by the user. It helps users to write a variety of content assignments, and complete legal documents, and press releases. Discover a revolution in content generation with our Fozzels AI Assistant. This tool is seamlessly integrated with your Magento store and OpenAI, leveraging the power of the ChatGPT AI to generate content for your store. Fozzels ChatGPT AI SAAS on the top of it offers Magento store merchants the flexibility to automatically write product content with the help of ChatGPT AI. It allows the store owners to write the product's short and long descriptions. The store owners can perform mass updates to add or update the bulk product content. The Fozzels software creates the product content as per the selected attributes (fields) and prompt. Creating unique, engaging content is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. This becomes even more challenging when managing a vast assortment of products or serving a multilingual customer base. Our software addresses the tedious task of content creation, offering an automated solution that effortlessly generates product descriptions, meta tags, blog posts, and more, customized to your specific requirements. Business Value Fozzels ChatGPT AI software is extremely favorable for eCommerce store merchants to write product descriptions effortlessly. Fozzels offers store owners to generate product descriptions automatically while not actively using the store Admin. Set it up once, and it automatically runs! Plan a Flow to run now, or at a time daily. It saves a lot of time for the store owner to write the product content by themselves, or by a separate SEO agency. The business merchants do not need to type or write the content, they just have to set up a Flow in Fozzels one time, and it will give the description as a result. In that way, the middleware simplifies the process of adding or updating the product content for the store owners. In short, Fozzels ChatGPT AI extension helps store admins generate product meta titles, keywords, and descriptions automatically. Instantly (batch) generate unique meta titles, keywords, and descriptions. Using Fozzels, the admin is freed from manually entering the meta titles, meta keywords, and meta descriptions of the products from the Magento admin dashboard. AI can generate this product metadata in a matter of seconds, thus saving the admin much time. Also, on-page SEO factors like meta titles and meta descriptions are important for ranking in Google. Magento 2 store admins can quickly generate product meta titles and meta descriptions by setting up one Flow. The Fozzels AI Content Generator for Magento 2 generates AI-curated SEO-friendly meta titles and meta descriptions, which helps in higher rankings. Fozzels ChatGPT software for Magento 2 is a game-changer in the world of product description generation. This feature-rich software empowers online store owners with a comprehensive set of functionalities to streamline the process and create compelling product descriptions effortlessly and automatically. With our ChatGPT software, you can revolutionize your product descriptions, captivate your customers, and save valuable time and effort. Unlock the power of automated description generation and elevate your online store's content strategy to new heights. Stay ahead of the competition and deliver a superior shopping experience with compelling product descriptions that drive conversions. Why choose Fozzels?

In a climate crisis, solar energy adoption is rising, but hurdles remain. Switzerland has nearly 2M buildings, but only 3% have solar panels, revealing an untapped market. Property owners find the process daunting due to a myriad of installers and complex paperwork. Installers struggle with surging demand, and large projects often stall due to funding gaps. SOLARSPLIT aims to remove these barriers by simplifying and democratizing the financing, monitoring, and installation of solar panels. Founded by Wilfried Josset and Lionel Brodard, SOLARSPLIT is a Neuchâtel-based startup offering three key services: installer matchmaking, AI-driven energy monitoring, and community green investment. Our initial focus is on the untapped Swiss market, with a strategic plan to expand across Europe.

Product insights are only as reliable as their underlying data. In today’s competitive digital landscape, companies rely heavily on these metrics to make growth decisions and build great user experiences. Despite companies spending $10B+ on product analytics software today, they are still left with insufficient product data obtained through manual, error-prone, and expensive pre-existing solutions. Eave addresses the root of this problem by establishing a reliable data infrastructure through automation, enabling teams to get better insights faster. Founded by a team of product and engineering from Honey, PayPal, Disney, and Amazon - Eave empowers emerging native-AI and AI-powered technologies to unlock the full power of product intelligence.

Feb 14, 2023
Our Mission: To use generative AI to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of medical record information. The Problem: Medical records are often inaccurate, incomplete, and difficult to access for both doctors and patients. This can lead to errors in diagnosis and treatment, and can also make it difficult for patients to manage their own care. Our Solution: Arnaque is developing a platform that uses AI to help doctors and patients record medical record information more accurately, efficiently, and accessibly. The platform will use natural language processing to understand the context of medical conversations, and will then generate structured data that can be easily stored and retrieved.

Feb 16, 2023
Impact investing is a $2.3 trillion industry. Per definition the investment should be linked to positive outcomes that benefit people & planet. Measuring impact is a complex and expensive process, which has led to institutions using their own unique methodology to suit their needs and budget. This leads to reporting errors at best. At worst, it leaves the industry vulnerable to greenwashing. A standardised and automated approach would result in millions in savings, more accuracy & trust. leonardo's B2B SaaS solution combines effective & trustworthy impact measurement with the challenges of fund management & investor relations. We enable effective primary data collection to provide actionable insights into the actual effects of products & services on people & planet through automatically generated surveys and API connections to IoT devices & third party software. With the tool being used by impact businesses & their capital providers, leonardo provides streamlined data pipelines and consistent communication throughout the entire capital flow. The high quality impact data is compliant with regulatory requirements & acknowledged impact reporting standards. Additionally, we leverage machine learning at several stages. First, recommendation engines help the user to select the right frameworks & standards. Large language models help to extract qualitative information from interviews & reports and to utilise it for impact calculations. Most importantly, ML-powered data validation enables us to assess the impact and strongly increases data quality & reporting credibility, thus mitigating the risk for greenwashing while reducing the need for third-party audits.

Feb 16, 2023
Robonair's mission is to revolutionize fresh fruit harvesting by reducing fruit wastage and lowering costs for consumers. We have pioneered innovative strategies and cutting-edge technologies to transform the multi-billion-dollar fresh fruit harvesting process. Within Robonair’s ecosystem, we have developed our own proprietary drone hardware and software system, along with a user-friendly flight management and route creation application that streamlines drone operations for convenience and control. Additionally, we have made substantial investments in advanced RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) and NTRIP (Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol) systems. These technologies provide us with near-centimeter-level position accuracy, establishing new industry standards and unlocking exciting possibilities for various applications. But we're not stopping there. We are actively working on a specialized robotic arm that can seamlessly attach to our drones for fruit picking. This arm is specifically tailored for fruit harvesting and seamlessly integrates with our existing drone system. By leveraging technologies like RTK and NTRIP, these drone-arm combinations operate in perfect harmony, all powered by a state-of-the-art Transformative Modal and artificial intelligence (AI) approach, in conjunction with our cutting-edge flight module. Our targeted solution addresses the labor-intensive nature of fruit harvesting, which currently relies heavily on manual labor and faces increasing challenges such as labor shortages and rising costs. Traditional heavy machinery offers limited benefits and accessibility to small and medium-sized farms. At Robonair, we are reshaping the future of agriculture, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable for everyone.

Online Property

Feb 23, 2023
Online Property connects real estate players, ensures transparency of deals and helps close them faster. Back to our experience and deep research, we see a lot of problems in the real estate industry that agents face every day. But we want to highlight the biggest: 1. Long time to close the deal. Agents spend a lot of time communicating, finding, checking, and making deals happen; 2. Every 5th property is fraud or non-actual 3. And we have zero transparency between agents. They don’t know the amount of fee that each agent can receive. They need to communicate in a manual direction. But at the same time, each agent is READY to share part of this fee with a partner agent if he quickly helps him close the deal. This is the basic principle of multi-listing systems. These days, the Emirates market doesn't have a tool for solving all the problems under one roof. And it’s sad because the market is losing money. The system has many benefits but we want to highlight a few of them: - Internal communication tool. So you don’t need to communicate with agents everywhere; - Multicasting system, fair two side agents revenue granted. I want to highlight what multicasting service means Multilisting service includes 3 main parts: 1. Agents cooperation process 2. Fair fee sharing 3. Multilisting database provides a common space for interaction - Only Verified properties; - Statistics on each agent. All these things in their fundamentals help close deals faster.

Imagine a future where using computers is as easy as talking to a friend. Where humans no longer need mouse movements and keyboard presses to figure out how to use software because you now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do. Agile Loop’s AL OS1 is making that a reality now. We’re an Artificial General Intelligence venture building a self-learning foundation model for Actionable AI Agents trained to act skilfully in the digital world. Our foundation model can operate any software user interface it sees with just human language prompts. It has an infinite context window, continually learns in production and therefore evolves and develops new capabilities based on your specific needs at run time. Foundation Model APIs (Third Party Integrations): 1) For Developers | Access our foundation model APIs to fine-tune and deploy a custom AI Agent trained to execute your choice of tasks and on your choice of Software/OS. 2) For Software Companies | Integrate our Model APIs to build a Co-pilot for your SaaS product and transform your user interface into a human language driven interface. Your users can simply prompt the AI to execute their tasks on your SaaS product. This way they won’t find difficulty in using your product’s interface and you won’t worry about losing users due to a complex UI. Search Action Engine (SaaS Subscription): A subscription-based AI agent trained to use browsers on your behalf and handle your web-based tasks. It allows users to operate all kinds of web apps through one chat interface. Talk to your browser and tell it to book flights and hotels online, do e-commerce activities such as online shopping on eBay, and much more. It surfs through the web in seconds, summarises results based on your prompt, and navigates the browser to complete your task. Join us on our mission to reinvent human-computer interactions and simplify software adoption and usability for all.

Hey there, welcome to Locusive. If you've ever navigated the maze of a SaaS tool and wished for a quicker way to find answers, or if you're a CSM feeling the weight of endless queries, we see you. We've been there too. We've seen time and again how important it is to service customers quickly, effectively, and accurately. Most businesses struggle to get customers everything they want and need when they ask for it. CSMs spin their wheels with data pulls, engineers that should be working on product have to come up with quick queries, and there's no time to service the long-tail of smaller customers that are all trying to gain value from your business or product. That's where the idea for Locusive was born. Our goal is to create an AI assistant that feels like a guide or concierge for your business. For users, it's about streamlining those moments of "how do I...?" and turning them into "oh, that's how!". And for the CSMs, it's about filtering out the noise, letting you focus on the deeper, more strategic aspects of your role. We're on a journey to blend technology with a bit of that human touch, making the digital space feel a tad more navigable and friendly. Interested in the evolving landscape of customer success and AI's role in it? Check us out at locusive.com.

Mar 2, 2023
Today, knowing who your customers are is one of the biggest problems facing offline businesses. Small and medium businesses with physical storefronts often struggle to identify their customers and manage their own technology stacks in order to piece together disconnected pieces of information. The process of customer identification should be transparent and simple for shoppers as one click, allowing businesses to combine all data silos into one tool that can bring together transaction information and customer data. Major point-of-sale (POS) providers are investing millions of dollars in improving their credit card processing part of the business, but there is little focus on customer identification and getting those customers to come back and shop more, increasing their average ticket value. We have taken on the difficult task of building the first platform that takes over the core customer identification experience. We connect all data from online and offline customer touchpoints into one single tool, allowing businesses to not only accurately identify their best customers, but also understand their purchase preferences and habits in order to embrace the entire customer experience and convert first-time shoppers into loyal fans, increase customer lifetime value, and drive more revenue for the business. It's simple: understand who your most valuable customers are, reward them, sell more. Repeat.

That is, our business is to implement technology as comfortably, clearly, and efficiently as possible, creating new areas for successful application of artificial intelligence. We want to become the technological Midas, we want people to say about us: "Everything they touch is endowed with a soul." We are capable of automating (teaching to speak) not only virtual agents, which are already constantly optimizing more and more contact centers, but also any other industry, sphere, business tool, or object of human life. Therefore, "Who are we?" - We are flexible in integrating voice technologies into business.

Xpdeep

Mar 29, 2023
XPDEEP is the first self-explainable deep learning engine for artificial intelligence combining transparency, low complexity and explainability understandable by humans. The XPDEEP solution simultaneously generates the deep model and its complete, accurate and intelligible explanations. The recent deployment of deep learning in organizations marks a new stage in the Artificial Intelligence revolution. But the models generated by deep learning engines are black boxes whose opacity and lack of explainability limit their adoption in many critical areas (defense, health...) or regulated (GDPR and AI Act) affecting the integrity of people, data protection, ethics, and the justification of decisions. In addition, the lack of explainability and transparency can lead to a lack of trust limiting the use of these models by both professionals and the public. Due to the lack of explainability of deep models, companies are still turning to solutions that offer lower performance and are easier to understand. Finally, the lack of explainability can be an obstacle to the rapid development of high-performance, robust, and controllable models. The explainability of deep models is therefore a real strategic issue for organizations, especially since it is known to be antinomic to performance. Attempts to explain current alternative solutions based on methods such as SHAP, LIME..., remain incomplete, imprecise and non-robust. The real break of the XPDEEP engine is the simultaneous generation of the deep model and its intelligible explanation, with performances already equal to or better than those of GAFAM standard deep learning engines, of comparable complexity. The solution proposed by XPDEEP is generic, it can involve different deep architectures, address the major tasks of AI, for the analysis of different types of data (time series, images, tabular, ...). XPDEEP is to date the only functional solution ensuring a complete, clear, and accurate restitution of decisions deployed by the deep learned models. With XPDEEP, the design of self-explainable deep learning models is finally possible!

So that it is much easier to communicate with them, so that they do not scare or repel with their complicated vibe. We set ourselves the goal of becoming a global specialist company in the field of conversational artificial intelligence. And we are no longer about technology, but about products. That is, our business is to implement technology as comfortably, clearly, and efficiently as possible, creating new areas for successful application of artificial intelligence. We want to become the technological Midas, we want people to say about us: "Everything they touch is endowed with a soul." We are capable of automating (teaching to speak) not only virtual agents, which are already constantly optimizing more and more contact centers, but also any other industry, sphere, business tool, or object of human life. Therefore, "Who are we?" - We are flexible in integrating voice technologies into business. As if we can animate any business process, any object familiar to humans that needs it and finds its application. That's why we are Human-like. We are Huli.

Xpdeep

Mar 29, 2023
XPDEEP is the first self-explainable deep learning engine for artificial intelligence combining transparency, low complexity and explainability understandable by humans. The XPDEEP solution simultaneously generates the deep model and its complete, accurate and intelligible explanations. The recent deployment of deep learning in organizations marks a new stage in the Artificial Intelligence revolution. But the models generated by deep learning engines are black boxes whose opacity and lack of explainability limit their adoption in many critical areas (defense, health...) or regulated (GDPR and AI Act) affecting the integrity of people, data protection, ethics, and the justification of decisions. In addition, the lack of explainability and transparency can lead to a lack of trust limiting the use of these models by both professionals and the public. Due to the lack of explainability of deep models, companies are still turning to solutions that offer lower performance and are easier to understand. Finally, the lack of explainability can be an obstacle to the rapid development of high-performance, robust, and controllable models. The explainability of deep models is therefore a real strategic issue for organizations, especially since it is known to be antinomic to performance. Attempts to explain current alternative solutions based on methods such as SHAP, LIME..., remain incomplete, imprecise and non-robust. The real break of the XPDEEP engine is the simultaneous generation of the deep model and its intelligible explanation, with performances already equal to or better than those of GAFAM standard deep learning engines, of comparable complexity. The solution proposed by XPDEEP is generic, it can involve different deep architectures, address the major tasks of AI, for the analysis of different types of data (time series, images, tabular, ...). XPDEEP is to date the only functional solution ensuring a complete, clear, and accurate restitution of decisions deployed by the deep learned models. With XPDEEP, the design of self-explainable deep learning models is finally possible!

Koya AI helps data aggregators such as marketplaces and procurement platforms to manage catalog data seamlessly. Instead of spending days manually chasing down, standardizing, and enriching product data, marketplaces can rely on Koya’s data-as-a-service offering. Bad data is the next frontier in ecommerce. Crucial services such as search and discovery, bringing new products live, and recommendations depend on product data quality. This data varies widely across providers and changes frequently, creating tremendous complexity. Today, most marketplaces and data aggregators manage these workflows manually, which is slow, inaccurate, and cumbersome. Seller listings are delayed, users have a poor on-site experience, and the marketplace sees lower conversion rates. Koya helps our clients obtain, normalize, and continually update product data with the power of Machine Learning.

Stellium Logo

Apr 28, 2023
Stellium is an application that leverages Gen AI and machine learning technologies to provide personalized, precise, and comprehensive predictions in the fields of astrology and personal awareness. This application will offer users daily, monthly, and yearly astrological projections, track planetary movements and analyze users' tension or tranquility levels. The problem intended to be solved is that astrology and personal awareness predictions often provide general, non-personalized, and limited information. This limits the benefits that users can derive from astrology. Our new application will offer advice on situations that users need to pay attention to and will provide personal reports such as solar return and transit chart without human intervention. Additionally, the application will help users identify compatible friends, colleagues, or romantic partners. In summary, this application will serve as a personal assistant available 24/7, enabling users to enhance their astrological knowledge and personal awareness without the need for an astrologer. The success of this project will solve this problem by offering personalized and precise predictions and will popularize the use of artificial intelligence in the field of astrology.

HyprWin Logo
HyprWin
11-50
May 1, 2023
Revolutionizing Sales with AI to Streamline Onboarding and Eliminate Non-Essential Tasks In the ever-evolving world of business, one thing remains constant: the challenges associated with the sales process. From lack of a clear value proposition, lack of an understanding of your product from a value-based approach, to not knowing what problems you’re trying to solve and how that relates to your prospect. The lack of asking your prospect good open-ended questions to find the gap, of what problems they face and how your product can help fill that gap, to unstructured onboarding and guidance, to the overwhelming amount of busy work that often doesn’t contribute to closing deals, we’ve seen sales reps, founders, and leaders struggle. At the same time, the tech industry is witnessing significant layoffs, with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta, and Zoom considerably reducing their workforces. This industry shift has caused a surge of talented tech professionals to venture into entrepreneurship, launch their own firms, or join smaller tech firms that present substantial growth opportunities. Moreover, we’re experiencing a groundbreaking era characterized by the emergence of Generative AI, heralding an exciting new wave of technology. This transformation in the tech landscape introduces compelling advancements and opportunities. In this dynamic context, we see a unique opportunity to assist these emergent ventures and tech firms grappling with articulating their unique value propositions. That’s where HyprWin comes into play. Our next-generation sales enablement platform, powered by advanced AI, is primed to meet the needs of this rapidly evolving landscape. It leverages this new wave of technology and taps into the immense pool of talent looking to make a mark. HyprWin’s primary objective is to optimize the sales process, from prospect identification to deal closure. We leverage AI technology to create a dynamic, swift, and focused workflow that guides you efficiently in the right direction. Our focus is not to replicate CRM systems, laden with unnecessary complexities where only a small fraction of the features are truly useful. We adopt a CRM-agnostic approach and offer API connectivity, allowing you to integrate our platform with your existing CRM solution seamlessly if you choose to do so. Our roots are in the realm of microservices and laser-focused sales processes. With HyprWin, we’ve streamlined the approach, enabling startups to efficiently market their unique value propositions and maintain that crucial focus to facilitate rapid sales. We stand as a resource for individual contributors and teams eager to accelerate their processes and articulate their value in the most effective manner possible. Here’s how HyprWin addresses the common challenges and can be particularly beneficial to startups and smaller tech firms in the current climate. Structured Onboarding: In the wake of tech layoffs expanding the talent pool, startups and smaller tech firms are ideally positioned to harness the skills of these high-caliber professionals. With HyprWin’s AI-Driven Workflow, we eliminate the prolonged and complex onboarding processes, allowing you to swiftly integrate these professionals into your sales process. Our platform serves as a comprehensive workflow, designed to guide anyone looking to sell their SaaS product from prospect to close. This means that new representatives, irrespective of their experience level, can hit the ground running with HyprWin, armed with the necessary insights and tools to excel. Guidance: Our platform provides continuous guidance throughout the sales cycle. From prospecting to closing deals, HyprWin’s AI guides reps every step of the way, ensuring they never feel lost or unsure of their next move, which is particularly crucial for startups that need to move quickly and efficiently. Eliminating Busy Work: With the rise of “revenge startups” by those affected by layoffs, there’s a need to focus on what matters most - building a quality product and closing deals. HyprWin automates various time-consuming tasks, freeing up sales reps to focus on these key aspects. From updating customer records to ranking lead quality, HyprWin handles the tedious tasks so your reps can focus on building relationships and closing sales. Reducing Non-Closing Activities: HyprWin streamlines the sales process by focusing on activities that directly contribute to deal closure. Our platform promotes clear communication and goal alignment with prospects, ensuring that reps spend their time on high-impact tasks that lead to sales. With HyprWin, sales reps are empowered to focus on what they do best: selling. Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with an intuitive user experience, revolutionizing the way sales teams operate and helping startups and teams to navigate the current landscape of the tech industry. With the ongoing economic disruption and the surge of startups, the current market conditions create an ideal environment for new businesses to emerge. A recent survey of 1,000 laid-off tech workers conducted by Clarify Capital LLC found that 63% of the respondents started their own company after their layoff. As these new startups rise from the ashes of tech industry layoffs, HyprWin stands ready to support these bold entrepreneurs and smaller techfirms in accelerating their sales and driving their success. In the end, we believe that the key to overcoming the challenges in the sales process lies in intelligent automation, actionable insights, and effective guidance. With HyprWin, we’re making that belief a reality, one sales team at a time. HyprWin is more than just a tool - it’s a game changer for those in the sales industry. Whether you’re an individual sales rep looking to streamline your process and sell value in the best way possible, or a startup aiming to sell your unique value proposition quickly and efficiently, HyprWin is designed to support you. We are committed to helping teams and startups navigate the changing landscape of the tech industry, turning challenges into opportunities and driving success.

In the fast-paced world of product development, Product Managers face a challenging landscape. Their main goal is to understand what their customers want and need, but they often run into several obstacles. There's data spread out everywhere, slow processes for gathering customer feedback, and the tough job of making sense of all the comments and suggestions they receive. That's where YOMO comes in, offering a helping hand. YOMO is designed to make the Product Managers' jobs easier by providing insights into what users are thinking and feeling. It brings together various tools like interviews, surveys, feedback collection, and usability testing into one platform, making it easier to see the big picture. YOMO integrates AI across all its features, from analyzing survey responses and feedback to understanding user behavior through session replays and heatmaps. This AI-driven approach ensures that insights are not just gathered but are made easily accessible and actionable. Product Managers can quickly identify patterns, understand user sentiments, and make informed decisions without getting bogged down by the complexity of data analysis. By using YOMO, Product Managers can make decisions based on real insights, not just numbers or assumptions. This makes it easier for them to create products that people love and use. YOMO aims to bridge the gap between collecting data and making decisions, doing it as quickly as possible. It’s like having an Intelligent assistant who's always on, always analyzing, and always ready to provide the next piece of the puzzle. This allows Product Managers to focus more on strategy & on improving experience and less on the tedium of data management and analytics. YOMO is not just a tool; it's a guide that helps Product Managers navigate through the complexity of their roles with ease. The AI presence in YOMO ensures that Product Managers are always equipped with the latest insights, making the journey from data to decision faster and more accurate.

Our products will address the needs of importers, who pay CBAM directly, as well as their suppliers and their customers. As carbon border taxes evolve and spread globally, Cbamboo plans to be at the forefront of helping firms to integrate carbon costs into their management decisions. Cbamboo was founded in May 2023 at Carbon13, the venture builder for the climate emergency, and is based in London.

Dune Security Logo
Dune Security
1-10
May 16, 2023
AI fighting AI. CISOs face an impossible risk landscape today. 80% of cybersecurity breaches start because of employee error. The problem is exacerbating with generative AI, as a single hacker can specifically target thousands of employees in the same amount of time that they used to specifically target tens of employees with social engineering. CISOs lack tools to deal with employee risk and are held accountable when a breach inevitably happens. By leveraging AI at each step, Dune Security empowers organizations to quantify individual risk through analyzing user behavior, context, learning patterns, and third party data. This allows the automation of tailored cybersecurity measures to each individual, transforming vulnerabilities into strengths. Dune is the central engine of all employee risk data, which is a solution that is not just timely for organizations but necessary in navigating the present cybersecurity landscape. This gives the CISO the capability to understand who are the high risk employees, to what extent, and why - as well as automatically remediate and restrict access to keep their organization safe. Today, Dune Security uniquely replaces legacy and ineffective security awareness training by pinpointing the crucial 8% of employees responsible for 80% of the risk, ensuring all employees receive personalized, machine learning-driven training tailored to their risk profile. CISOs also have easy access to quantifiable data via robust reporting and API-out capability, enabling them to both report to compliance auditors, regulators, and insurance underwriters, as well as restrict access to high-risk employees through other security systems.

We are currently combining different machine learning architectures, such as transformers along with more generative-focused problem solving architectures, to deliver as much real-world performance practical usefulness for Internet users as possible while using as little computational resources and algorithmic complexity on my end. We've also combined convolutional networks for image/video intelligence as well as other forms of data when appropriate. We very conscious to only use algorithmically efficient algorithms and to minimize the need for any computation or other costs on my end as possible. We've had extensive first-hand experience on how expensive cloud and local hardware is, so have learned to always maximize revenue-to-cost ratio, rather than run anything inefficient or worse yet throw more threads at bad algorithms. One way to achieve this is to use ChatGPI's API or plugin (We were invited as an early developer for plugins but haven't submitted it for review yet) to use their large language models to power some of my application features, without having to build everything from scratch. We were also invited to the Google Cloud Startup Program and will soon be using the Google Bard API via GCP. The goal of this application is to promote a healthier lifestyle for Internet users, such as by intelligently deliver useful analysis (and follow up queries/analysis) when appropriate, promote free and reliable content such as those found on government websites, major newspapers, and reputable educational creators on YouTube. We also developing features to warn users of potentially deceptive, dangerous, and unproductive (waste of user's time) websites. Additionally, we are building time-management tools to help users better able to live the life they truly may desire to live, rather than spending too much time as victims of often predatory short-term additions available on the Internet.

Panza's AI platform uses custom trained, supervised LLMs to help financial institutions proactively mitigate balance sheet risk and product compliance exposure. Risk and compliance management is human capital intensive, and speed is more important than ever. Banks spend up to 6-10% of their revenue on risk and compliance functions, but still struggle to keep up, with $548B lost to insolvent banks in 2023, and regulators assessing billions of dollars in fines each year. According to the American Banker Association, 59% of U.S. banks surveyed say they are very concerned about their ability to manage risk across all lines of business, and a similar percentage were very concerned about maintaining compliance with changing regulations. Panza simplifies and enhances risk and compliance management with a specialized AI continuously monitoring and evaluating risks across regional and global market data, bank portfolios, news, social media, regulatory releases, and bank products. For less than the cost of an FTE, with Panza financial institutions can reduce balance sheet risks, automatically enforce regulatory compliance in their products, and transform risk analysis and mitigation workflows through a chat interface.

Il check-in intelligente BNB con un'app si riferisce a un processo in cui gli ospiti possono effettuare il check-in nei loro alloggi utilizzando un'applicazione mobile invece di una chiave fisica o incontrando un host. Questa tecnologia utilizza serrature intelligenti e altri dispositivi connessi per offrire agli ospiti un'esperienza di check-in semplice e sicura. Con un'app per il check-in BNB intelligente, gli ospiti possono accedere ai propri alloggi da remoto inserendo un codice univoco o utilizzando il proprio smartphone come chiave. L'app può anche fornire agli ospiti informazioni importanti sul loro soggiorno, come orari di check-in e check-out, consigli locali e istruzioni su come utilizzare elettrodomestici e altri servizi. I vantaggi dell'utilizzo di un'app di check-in BNB intelligente includono una maggiore comodità per gli ospiti, operazioni semplificate per gli host e una maggiore sicurezza. Gli ospiti possono effettuare il check-in a proprio piacimento senza doversi preoccupare di coordinarsi con l'host o preoccuparsi della perdita delle chiavi. Gli host possono anche risparmiare tempo e denaro nella gestione delle chiavi, avendo anche un maggiore controllo su chi ha accesso alla loro proprietà. Nel complesso, il check-in BNB intelligente con un'app è un modo moderno ed efficiente per gli host di gestire i loro alloggi e per gli ospiti di godersi un'esperienza di check-in senza problemi.

Ordalie AI Logo
Ordalie AI
1-10
Jun 5, 2023
Ordalie is a generative AI dedicated to the law: a “ChatGPT" of the law. It's a project that aims to drastically reduce the time spent by legal professionals and managers (SMEs) on legal research and contract drafting. To achieve this, we have developed our own specialized AI models that are directly connected in real time to all legal sources. We automate legal work through multiple instances of autonomous, workload-balanced AI agents, working at scale at human-level precision. Ordalie was born out of the realization that legal information is disparate and unintelligible, which can lead to a considerable loss of time in researching it and returning it to the customer. When I worked in a law firm, 60% of my time was spent doing legal research and then trying to articulate all the information I'd gathered to extract a clear, structured response for the client. AI meets this need to optimize the time spent on legal research and drafting. At this stage, we are initially co-developing our product with several of the most prestigious partner law firms, to ensure that the reliability of our legal answers is in line with the standards of the most advanced and experienced legal professionals. But as our ambition is to provide easier access to and better understanding of the law, we are not only targeting legal professionals, but also the managers of very small businesses who face legal issues on a daily basis. The idea is to help the manager of a small structure who would not be financially able to hire a full-time legal expert or seek the advice of a lawyer as frequently as he or she would like. Today, the legaltech market focuses exclusively on legal professionals. However, our AI adapts to all levels of understanding and requirements without having to reinvent the product for each target, which means that legal knowledge is not just for lawyers. So we're positioning ourselves as a B2B SaaS model with two offerings. • A €69/user/month subscription (beta launch price); • An API offer (billed by volume) already in place with several partners, enabling them to implement our technology on their interface for the benefit of their customers.

Jun 5, 2023
"agenci3 indeed sounds unique and fills a specific niche in the market. Local and state political candidates often lack the resources and support that national-level candidates have, so a service like this could be very beneficial for them. Simulating interviews and debates is a particularly innovative use of AI." - OpenAI to Jeff Bodzewski 07.07.2023 Agenci3 is more than the first generative AI campaign advisor to craft compelling content, and simulate interviews with actual media and debate opponents. We are the competitive advantage to help the typically underfunded and understaffed 560,000+ local and state candidates win elections. Our ChatGPT-4 powered LLM has been exhaustively trained and refined by senior advisers with backgrounds in public affairs to generate personalized content that resonates with voters and moves them to action. Each piece of content used to train our models is reviewed by our team to ensure the source is credible, factual and with a strong bias for writings, transcripts and other publicly available content. agenci3 never uses automated processes to scrape web for content so we can ensure the integrity of our model. A recent academic paper by experts from Oxford, Cambridge and other universities found "that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models.” agenci3 is deliberately built to deliver long-term value to its customers and investors alike. Our subscription service beginning at $99/month is affordable, easy to use and accessible from anywhere. But most importantly, it's effective.

Virtual Officer brings to market a new concept called Unified Data Privacy & Protection Management. Right now, many companies use dozen of systems to manage data privacy and protection activities like Risk Management, Gap Analysis, Data Mapping, Vendor Assessment, and other but each area uses its own systems and they don't connect each other generating a lot of misinformation and extra work to sync data from one to another. Virtual Officer unify all that information in one platform, allowing companies input business data in one place and sync to all platforms, reducing work, unifying information, and generating dashboards for all levels (C-level, operations, and all). Designed with an intuitive interface, the Virtual Officer platform could be used by small companies with no one responsible by data privacy and protection activities. With an AI assistant, the platform will be able to recommend improvements in data privacy and protection besides help in daily tasks. Virtual Officer can also be used by large companies, with a wide range of professionals working on this subject, as a tool to manage activities, optimize work, and unify information.

After the pandemic, 43% of young US adults felt an increase in their loneliness. While it might seem like COVID-19 is a thing of the past, the numbers of depressed and lonely adults continue to rise.

Rememberizer integrates with Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Dropbox, and more. It also allows data to be uploaded directly from a synced folder. Rememberizer easily integrates with OpenAI GPTs in as little as a few minutes, and with custom applications. Popular applications include enabling users to talk to use genAI to talk to their Slack Channel, Sub-Reddit, Gmail, and other shared repositories of knowledge.

It is distinct for its focus on security, centralized management, managed app deployment, low cost, and ability to operate in a vendor agnostic way using many LLMs public and private.

Educational Intelligence
1-10
Jul 2023
Nearly half of working age adults do not have the numeracy expected at primary school - that's 20 million just in the UK! Businesses and governments are spending big money on learning programmes to help them improve. New regulatory rules require Financial Services firms to ensure customers - especially the vulnerable - can understand the products they sell, but just simplifying the brochure language is no longer enough. Governments are running costly programs, such as the UK's US$700m Multiply program that we advise, to improve numeracy to drive up inclusion, social mobility and economic participation. Educational Intelligence (EI) uses Educational Psychology and advanced/generative AI to address this problem at scale - especially for the anxious/reluctant learner. We cover topics that are important to adult learners, such as financial literacy, life skills numeracy and workplace numeracy and engage them with content and experience that is relevant and personalised to their specific needs.

That's a compelling overview of your company, isiri.ai, and your platform. You have clearly defined the problem you're addressing and your unique approach to solving it. However, your introduction could be further strengthened by including a few additional details. Here's a refined version: “**Interactive Support for Intelligent Realization of Ideas using AI ** At [isiri.ai](http://isiri.ai/), we are committed to democratizing the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technologies. Our core mission revolves around creating an accessible and interactive platform that enables users from various domains to take advantage of the potent capabilities of GPT technologies, irrespective of their technical prowess. We have identified a key challenge – the complexity of developing effective GPT prompts – which acts as a deterrent for many potential users. To overcome this obstacle, our platform focuses on two main aspects: simplification and collaboration. We simplify the process of creating GPT prompts, making it user-friendly and intuitive. We also foster collaboration between users and prompt developers, encouraging continuous feedback and iterative refinement. This unique combination allows us to ensure the final products are perfectly tailored to the needs of the users. As part of our services, we offer dedicated support to translate industry-specific expertise into practical AI applications. This allows us to facilitate the creation of high-quality, user-oriented GPT tools, contributing to our broader goal of enhancing the reach and impact of AI. Our ultimate aim at [isiri.ai](http://isiri.ai/) is to break down the barriers that prevent individuals and organizations from harnessing the transformative power of GPT technologies. We envision a world where advanced AI tools are not just limited to tech-savvy users, but can be leveraged by everyone to fuel innovation and growth." For advancing and completing your project, here are some key recommendations: 1. **Customer Feedback:** Constantly solicit user feedback. This will ensure your platform is continuously improving and aligning with the needs of your target audience. 2. **User Interface:** Prioritize the development of a user-friendly interface. The ease of use will be a key factor in attracting and retaining users who aren't tech-savvy. 3. **Partnerships:** Partner with organizations or individuals who are domain experts. Their knowledge can help to build effective GPT prompts and they can serve as evangelists for your platform. 4. **Security and Privacy:** As you'll be handling user data, invest heavily in security infrastructure. Ensuring data privacy will build trust with your users. 5. **Marketing and Education:** Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy that also includes educating potential users about the benefits and possibilities of GPT technologies. This can help drive adoption. 6. **Scale Up:** Initially, you can focus on a niche market to test and refine your offerings. Once you're confident about the product-market fit, you can plan to scale up. 7. **Funding:** Depending on your financial situation, you might need to raise capital to support the development and scaling of your platform. Consider approaching venture capitalists who have a history of investing in AI technology startups. These are just some ideas that could help you in refining your startup and making it more attractive to both users and potential investors.

HelpAI Logo
HelpAI

Jul 28, 2023
HelpAI addresses a longstanding challenge in the professional landscape—tapping into the vast potential of young talent. In the rapidly evolving workforce, businesses often struggle to discover and connect with the right talent, leading to missed opportunities and underutilized resources. This has persisted as a 16-year-old problem affecting 75% of employers, making talent acquisition increasingly difficult. Problem: Missed Opportunities: Traditional methods of talent acquisition, relying on job boards, HRM tools, and virtual communication tools, are time-consuming and inefficient, resulting in missed opportunities and limited network diversity. High Costs: The current process typically costs companies 3x - 4x the base salary for a role, making it financially burdensome. Solution: HelpAI offers a comprehensive solution by leveraging AI-powered professional networking to bridge the gap between untapped talent and employers. The platform facilitates efficient connections, unlocking the growth potential of businesses and fostering a more diverse and dynamic workforce. The focus is on matching founders with co-founders initially, with plans to introduce new matching platforms for various professional relationships. Key Features: AI-Powered Matching: HelpAI allows users to input the skills and expertise they need, either through text or voice, and the system seamlessly matches them with precise profiles. Founder-Focused: Initial emphasis on matching founders with co-founders, with plans to expand into other professional relationships. Diverse Talent Pool: The platform aims to cater to the African market, projecting a user base of 20+ million with a 33% conversion rate from free to paid plans. Vision: HelpAI envisions revolutionizing the global workforce by empowering professionals with effortless connections. The platform aspires to create a borderless community that not only drives innovation but also generates positive impact on a global scale.

Nurdle AI

Sep 2023
87% of AI projects never make it to production. Whether it’s because they are inaccurate, hallucinate, don’t work in real-world contexts, misunderstand real people or that they’re stuck before they start because of the “cold-start problem”, the issue comes down to not enough high-quality use-case specific, privacy-compliant labeled data for training. But real-world human-labeled data is expensive and requires a lot of data science labor – and synthetic data is so low-quality and unrelated to the model’s actual use-case that it doesn’t improve performance much. Nurdle can help. By using real-world human-labeled kernel datasets built for specific use-cases, we produce enhanced synthetic datasets that perform almost as well as human-labeled at the speed and price of synthetic datasets. Contact us for a free data gap analysis showing you what kind of data you’re missing and how much you need for your performance target. Nurdle AI uses real-world custom use case datasets to generate synthetic datasets for accurate LLMs.

Unlocking YouTube's Potential: The Power of Video, Amplified in Text & AI Hey there— I'm Caglar, the heartbeat behind TranscribeTube. YouTube is a goldmine. A never-ending tapestry of ideas, stories, and emotions. It's the stage where creativity dances freely, capturing moments and messages from every corner of the globe. And in this ever-expanding universe, every video is a voice wanting to be heard. But here's the twist. While YouTube's galaxy expands, our time on this planet remains finite. We find ourselves sprinting against the relentless tide of content, trying to grasp its essence while balancing our ticking clocks. The beauty of a video is its depth, but the charm of a text? Its brevity. That's why TranscribeTube came to life.

Ivyngton means personalized insurance, just for you. The insurance maze has left many feeling lost, unheard, and undervalued. That's why Ivyngton is here to chart a new course. Ivyngton transforms the insurance landscape with an innovative AI-enabled approach. Personalizing each policy: Everyone is unique, with distinct needs and concerns. At Ivyngton, we believe your insurance should reflect just that. Instead of providing a generic policy, our advanced 63B parameter insurance quote model is designed to understand and cater to your specific requirements. This not only ensures that you're covered for what truly matters to you but also provides us with precise insights into the risk profiles of the policies we craft for each individual. Assured insurance: We are the only insurance company which will pay your claim even if the underwriter refuses to. If your claim isn't paid by our underwriters, we step in. Our legal team fights for all unpaid claims, no matter how small, and we charge only 20% of the recovered amount. Lower risk: Instead of confusing terms and hidden fees like traditional insurance companies, we only take 30% of premiums as profit and give the remaining 70% to our underwriters. In return, these underwriters shoulder 100% of the risk. AI-categorized policies: By harnessing the power of our models, we offer underwriters precise risk categorization for millions of personalized policies. This means faster approvals, fewer denials, and more accurate pricing for customers. Transparent, accessible, and efficient: Our customer dashboard is an instant one-stop-shop for all of your policies, whether taken out by you or your employer, saving you time and stress, allowing you easy one-click claims and one-click access of all of your documents. Experience the difference of having assurance beyond insurance. Say Goodbye to nightmare experiences and Hello to an ally in your corner.

One of the primary goals of addoobot (www.addoobot.com) is to make robotics accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or expertise level. By offering a platform where professionals, academics, researchers, hobbyists, and curious individuals can come together, addoobot aims to break down barriers to entry and make these fields more inclusive. As a first of its kind, addoobot provides a space for individuals to share their thoughts, ideas, projects, and expertise related to robotics and AI. By fostering a vibrant community where members can engage with each other, collaborate on projects, and exchange knowledge and experiences, addoobot facilitates learning and growth within the field. So addoobot isn't just for professionals, academics, researchers, and hobbyists to share their robotic projects and connect with customers, receive feedback, and collaborate; it's also a platform for anyone interested in robotics to learn, explore, find entertainment, and more! With a strong background in robotics, addoobot team recognizes that the needs of industry professionals may differ from those of academics or the general public. Therefore, we're dedicated to creating features and tools that cater to everyone's needs, although this is an ongoing process with many more features planned for the future. In addition to robotics, addoobot also features AI Tools (www.addoobot.ai), but with a unique approach. Unlike other AI Tool directories, we aim to maintain a high-quality selection of around 1000 to 1500 tools at most. We're selective about the AI Tools we feature, regularly updating and removing them to ensure the list continually improves over time. We prioritize quality over quantity to simplify your search for the right AI tool, understanding that more choices can sometimes lead to less satisfaction (the "Paradox of Choice").

It’s simple. Textok is the SaaS tool that automates writing guidelines. Create one source of truth for all your corporate communication. Forget about AI-based black-box solutions where you choose between tones like “very formal” or “friendly” — they don't put you in control if you want to tune or change anything. They are just not working for a brand that wants to always hit a distinct cord. With Textok you can go deep into style and tone definition using over 90 parameters (and growing!), apply custom dictionaries, and ensure compliance and communications consistency with one click. Apply rules for better flow, structure, choice of words, and emotionality — rules that you choose yourself. Write your way. Developed for enterprises, agencies and freelance writers, communicating to several audiences or writing for several brands, Textok is a go-to solution for those who produce a lot of content on a regular basis (written by human or AI — Textok works with both!). With Textok you can *Generate or rewrite texts with AI, using your custom tone prompts * validate or match any text’s tone of voice * define custom tones for each of your channels or audience types * use custom dictionaries .. and much more.

Nov 13, 2023
visualAI, a cutting-edge SaaS company, empowers e-commerce businesses with AI-driven solutions that revolutionize product discovery, enhance user engagement, and boost revenue. Our flagship product, shopperGPT, is a game-changing multimodal conversational shopping agent. Here’s how it works: Hyper-Personalized Shopping Experience: shopperGPT seamlessly integrates into e-commerce platforms, offering shoppers a personalized journey. Users can search for products using natural language, find products based on any specific color, or even submit images to find visually similar matches. Retrieval Augmented Generation & Fine-Tuned LLMs: Our technology combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with client-specific data. By augmenting and fine-tuning LLM responses, we ensure accurate and context-aware search results. Additionally, we employ data augmentation techniques to further optimize accuracy. Platform Expansion: Initially available directly, shopperGPT will soon integrate with popular e-commerce platforms like Magento, BigCommerce, Salesforce, and Shopify. Our mission? To fundamentally transform how shoppers discover products online, starting with the fashion vertical. Why VisualAI Matters for Retailers: Engagement Boost: Visual search can increase session durations by up to 30%, while click-through rates improve by approximately 15-25%. Shoppers stay longer and interact more, enhancing overall engagement. Hyper-personalization is shown to dramatically improve user engagement, time on the site and purchases. Accelerated Discovery: Visual search reduces the user journey time by nearly 50%. In sectors like fashion and home décor, this efficiency translates to a 10-15% increase in customer satisfaction ratings. Revenue Uplift: Implementing visual search leads to a 20-30% rise in conversion rates. Simplified discovery processes and impulse purchases contribute to an average order value increase of 10-20%. Moreover, the data collected via visual search refines recommendation algorithms, potentially boosting upsell and cross-sell rates by up to 25% visualAI isn’t just a technological advancement; it’s a strategic business move that elevates user experience, streamlines product discovery, and positively impacts the bottom line.

LynxCraft is a building design platform powered by a new and patented construction method. The platform is one of a kind, enabling anyone to design a building and printout the documentation needed for a building permit in minutes. This isn’t possible by any technique or software currently available. The platform acts an engine connecting RE developers and panel producers. It empowers RE developers by lowering their costs and significantly shortening time to market. The technology empowers panel producers to achieve maximum levels of standardization and therefore lowers costs and makes them much faster, turning construction into massive production of typical elements. Lynx technology is an algorithmic building system based on a finite amount of building blocks. 19 typical elements (panels) that are 100% prefabricated (down to the last socket and facade). The system enables the construction of everything from single-family houses to multistory buildings, which can be designed and erected in record time.

The solution is DocuSeer, an AI powered messenger app bot that talks to all your internal policies and can provide immediate answers and send the policy document that the answer came from using your messenger app (i.e. Slack). We’re committed to making our product: 1. Easy to use - no training is needed as it integrates seamlessly with your messenger app that all employees are already using 2. Highly accurate answers to internal questions 3. Easy to implement, less than 10 hours of your time, yet tailored to your Company’s specific needs

At Nationsfirst, we strive to dismantle the systemic barriers that have contributed to Indigenous peoples experiencing high rates of poverty, suicide, child apprehension, and financial illiteracy, a reality often overlooked in the world’s wealthiest nations. This disparity was poignantly termed "The Fourth World" by George Manuel, a respected Indigenous leader in Canada, to reflect the stark contrast between the quality of life experienced by Canadians and Indigenous peoples. We blend advanced financial technologies with traditional values, offering solutions that include: 1) A fintech platform that uses AI and blockchain (Delegated Proof of Stake mechanism) for digital banking services, with a stablecoin backed by assets like gold, silver, and uranium. 2) A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that leverages governance tokens to manage and verify user citizenship across Indigenous nations, fostering community-driven governance through a Proof of Identity (PoID) consensus.

We are solving herd management challenges in dairy farms by using image processing instead of IOT devices. Current outdated techniques implemented on farms involve the use of IOT devices attached to various body parts of cattle, such as legs and neck and attempting to gather data related to cattle movements. However, those approaches are too expensive when it is considered that each cattle has to wear these gears and life span of these devices are not long enough due to their embedded battery not lasting long and tough farm environment. Instead, Tekno Sürüm can identify lameness, early estrus symptoms, birth symptoms etc. and even more, faster and accurate than compared to existing approaches via fixed Cameras powered by Artificial Intelligence. Thus, our solution becomes much more cost effective.
