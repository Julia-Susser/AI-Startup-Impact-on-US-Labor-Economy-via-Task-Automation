90% of B2B buying happens during a buyer's internal meetings — not sales meetings. When champions pitch and teams debate your product's value, without sales reps around. But most champions wing their message, or create their own materials, because they won’t send templates and marketing materials to their boss. That's why Fluint uses your buyer's own words to generate a message your prospects are proud to champion with you. Exec summaries, business cases, emails, MAPs and more, built for every deal in your pipeline.

Cytix is the first truly continuous security testing platform, focused on identifying change and using it to intelligently determine when to test. Whether it’s a developer making a pull request, threat intelligence about a new vulnerability, or a new server being deployed, we take feeds of data from across your technology stack and use this as telemetry to determine what has changed and what actions need to be taken to assess the impact that this has had on security. Simply connect us to your existing workflows through our list of pre-built integrations or leverage the suite of native tools within our platform. We bridge the gap between automation and manual testing by identifying what actions are needed at any time and carrying them out as a sequence of tasks. Through this, we are able to minimise the time between vulnerabilities being introduced and being identified, and provide the information you need in order to resolve them as efficiently as possible. We support applications, APIs, cloud-native services, and traditional infrastructure, providing you with a centralised platform from which to build a continuous security testing programme. We are CREST-accredited and our product can either be used to drive an internal security testing programme, or as a fully managed service. Watch as your entire security testing programme runs automatically.

N-Smart simplifies the adoption of IoT, making the nation's grids reliable and resilient. Currently, many utility companies rely on a manual approach to restore services after a major outage, which can be inefficient and time-consuming. This involves assessing damage to poles and assets, mobilizing the right resources, and ensuring the availability of materials. However, N-Smart allows energy transmission and distribution companies to expedite restoring energy services using IoT. With N-Smart, utility companies can remotely monitor the condition of utility poles during a storm, monitor the availability and compliance of tools in service trucks, and automate supply management to ensure the availability of necessary materials for restoration. The platform connects multiple sensor data to a central system through the right connectivity in a unified dashboard. N-Smart's innovative system empowers companies to make informed decisions and streamline the restoration process. Additionally, with AI-enabled applications, N-Smart can automate regular processes, predict scenarios, and simulate smart behavior. This ensures utility companies can restore power quickly and efficiently, avoiding significant delays and minimizing disruption and inconvenience to customers and businesses.

Eventual is the developer behind Daft, an open-sourced query engine that runs on 800k CPU cores daily. Which is more compute than Frontier, the world's largest supercomputer! Today's data tooling (Spark, Presto, Snowflake) was built for a world of tabular data analytics, but does not generalize to the needs of modern ML/AI such as multimodal data, heterogenous compute and user-defined Python algorithms. Eventual and Daft bridge that gap, making ML/AI workloads easy to run alongside traditional tabular workloads. Eventual was founded in 2022 and is based in San Francisco, California.

Luca Logo
Luca

2022
Pricing Strategy is one of the most powerful levers that retailers have at their disposal to create growth, yet it is underleveraged. Most retail pricing teams settle for making decisions in spreadsheets, shooting in the dark, and working backward from a cost-plus margin target, leaving a LOT of money on the table. Our founders experienced these problems at scale when they built pricing tech at Uber that made Uber a billion dollars in profit a year. They realized that retail was lacking the same quality and sophistication of price tooling. So, they built Luca. Luca is an AI-powered co-pilot for retail operators, which constantly identifies revenue and profit headroom, makes recommendations for price adjustments and saves countless work hours along the way. Luca is backed by Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, and others.

We help companies build applications based on LLMs (and other Transformer models) and deploy them on private infrastructure. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) You can build a RAG workflow by deploying off-the-shelf components and prototype a system that works for your case. We support many auxiliary features, including reverse tracing of output to documents, and ingestion for many file formats. Agents Enable the LLM to use tools by leveraging Agents. An Agent-powered system can decide which data it needs and search for it. Our implementation of Agents provides a simple hosting for execution layers and pre-build Agents for many use cases. UI Playground Connect all components without writing any code. Experiment with prompts, system commands, and custom LLMs by dropping them in a visual diagram. We support custom LLMs, vector storages, system commands, and soon embedding models, Agents, and auto- generated documentation. Other Transformers Build applications for voice recognition, translation and other tasks by leveraging specialized models. Containerise the Workflow When you have defined the workflow, evaluated it, and presented it to your stakeholders, you can get everything in one Docker container (inc. models), ready to run on your private server. We use powerful state-of-the-art compression pipelines to optimise models and make sure that your backend is cheap and fast.

"Who are well-siblings?" you might ask. If your sibling is dealing with a life-limiting condition, you are a well-sibling. You might feel that you are the only person in the whole world whose life is like this. When a sibling is sick, parents usually spend their time helping them get better. You might have to help at times too. It isn’t surprising if sometimes you feel like they’ve forgotten all about you. We all have ups and downs in life; you might be sadder sometimes or feel bad cause you don’t know what to do but not tell anyone because you don’t want to have them worried. You are not alone in your journey. I’m going through a very similar situation. Honestly, I can certainly use a friend like you to talk to cause I know you’ll get me. I know we can be good friends, and I promise I’m a good listener.

Cinematronic Logo
Cinematronic

2022
Cinematronic is engaged in two ground-breaking product lines to significantly increase the viewer experience for audiovisual content via biometric user-reaction insights. Firstly, we are developing a patent-pending interactive, adaptive media system. A lot of content does not live up to users’ expectations, resulting in a loss of interest over time. Our system ensures a consistently high-quality user experience throughout the user’s media consumption. Besides making adaptable stories, the solution will become a fully automated quality assurance system. Using biosensors, the system detects the psychophysiological reaction of users and automatically adjusts the content based on their immediate needs. Moreover, we are working on Biometric Quality Assurance. Conventionally, media production companies invest a significant amount of time and money in creating high-quality productions. Yet, this is not always a warranty for success. Quality assurance is often not used within the creative production phase but rather at the end of production when most of the financial and creative resources have already been spent. Our quality assurance solution uses biosensors as part of the research design within the creative process, dramatically increasing the level of user insight provided – making it easier for producers to tailor the user experience to their target audience before finalizing the productions.

Cyclops Security Logo
Cyclops Security

2022
SecOps teams play a crucial role in fortifying an organization's cybersecurity defenses, safeguarding valuable and sensitive assets. The rapid evolution of cyber threats forces SecOps teams to handle numerous alerts and findings, prioritize vulnerabilities, and understand their risk within their organization’s environment. However, when an average organization has about 70 different cybersecurity solutions, gathering data from all of them, correlating and analyzing it to answer different questions becomes a difficult, time consuming, and a frustrating task. Cyclops’s cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity mesh (CSMA) platform enables SecOps to answer any question, no matter how complex it is, within a few seconds. It enables security professionals to easily prioritize security risks and mitigate exposures. Cyclops implements a Mesh Architecture approach by implementing AI to consolidate security data from the organization's security and IT technology stack, normalizing, deduplicating and contextualizing it. It creates a single unified source of truth for SecOps. By leveraging LLM, it enables security professionals to submit any question, in free text, and get instant answers that allow them to dig further for more information. If users aren’t sure about questions they should ask, CyclopsIQ suggests relevant queries based on the user’s role, current insights and past activities. Cyclops’s dashboards provide a high level view of the current security posture helping executives plan further.

2022
Fabrica AI is creating a future where ideating and developing a robot for any task takes days, not years. We believe that by training end to end controls in simulation with reinforcement learning and above that iterating hardware designs, we can automate the whole development process. At the current stage, the most important resource is a large fleet of robots to validate our approaches for our AI system and to collect data. This would help keep us grounded in reality. To start building up the fleet, we invented an automatic tile grouting robot that boosts productivity by 5x and are piloting it on construction sites in Singapore managed by Woh Hup, BHCC, Gin Chia, Soilbuild, and Dragages. We have early leads in the US and Europe as well. Tile grouting is the process of filling up the gaps between tiles after the tiles have been laid. Grouting is part of virtually every construction project and a highly laborious process, is considered one of the most physically damaging tasks resulting in tilers’ knees and back issues, and thus quality issues would also arise. We invented a patent pending robot that is able to automatically grout and clean tile gaps with only a press of a button. The operators would only need to reload grout and water. We are headquartered in Delaware, and have offices in Singapore and Brno, Czech Republic. Demo locations include Zurich, Miami, London/Cambridge, and Vienna.

It is designed to be a comprehensive online community based on the principles of Islamic law, with a variety of features including news, information, a mosque directory, a marketplace for Islamic goods and services, and more. The social network is moderated to ensure that all content aligns with Islamic values. Problem Statement: Conventional social networks, dating services, and digital currencies often promote and allow the sharing of content and values that are in direct conflict with Islamic principles and beliefs. For example, many of these platforms encourage extramarital relationships, which is strictly forbidden in Islam. Furthermore, conventional social networks may not have proper mechanisms in place to filter out or restrict access to content that is deemed offensive or inappropriate according to Islamic teachings. This can lead to Muslims being exposed to harmful or inappropriate material, further compounding the issue. Given these challenges, it is important for Muslims to seek out alternative platforms that align with their beliefs and values. These platforms should prioritize the protection and promotion of Islamic principles, while also offering features and services that are in line with the teachings of Islam. Solution: Umma Life provides a safe and secure platform that is based on Sharia principles and prohibits content that contradicts Islamic values.This platform serves as the foundation of the UmmaLife ecosystem, and allows users to connect, share, and engage with each other. It includes a social network, a marketplace, education platform, marriage agency and a cryptocurrency, UMMA Token, which helps to create a self-sufficient ecosystem within the social network. The solution consists of several key components that work together within the UmmaLife ecosystem: Umma Marketplace marketplace is designed to support the halal economy and promote entrepreneurship within the Muslim community Umma Education provides users with the opportunity to organize and participate in online learning Umma.Nikah is designed to promote the idea of a halal and moral relationship and is based on Sharia principles. UMMA Token: UMMA Token is an important component of the Umma Life ecosystem and can be used for a variety of purposes, including promoting content, purchasing goods and services in the marketplace, investing in the platform, and more. Tokens can also be earned through active engagement on the social network, such as creating and uploading content, commenting, and reporting prohibited content. Token Utility: The UMMA Token is designed to support and stimulate the growth of the Umma Life ecosystem.

Resolute Future

2022
Entrepreneurship is like going through life left handed. Everything is harder than it should be. Outside the Silicon Valley bubble, this is even more true. You have to piece together all the resources yourself. Even if you have relationships to guide you, the result is one size fits all solutions that may not be best for your business. At the same time, the need for support for startups is growing drastically as people realized they can work remotely and start a business from home. Or they move to start a business outside of the big expensive cities. The result, is a startup support gap. The startup support gap means startups are fighting gravity just to make it. Current solutions aren't equipped to handle the startup support gap. We have accepted that 90% of businesses fail and there's nothing we can do about it. So the startup support gap lives on terrorizing anyone with the courage to take on the status quo. Until now...

Each traveller is individually matched to 7 locals and then books a travel activity with one of them. The idea behind the concept is novel but simple: like-minded people are certain to have memorable experiences together, sometimes even turning into a friendship. Our best travel memories are almost always about amazing locals - we just don't know how to meet our soulmates every time we travel - it is always random or a matter of luck.

2022
spoon.tech is an AI-powered restaurant SaaS for process simplification and employee growth. spoon.tech provides restaurant operators with AI-powered intuitive tools to (finally) systemize processes in their restaurants and enable employee learning. spoon.tech functionality in the essence consists of two parts: • Web-based application for restaurant managers and owners • Mobile application for restaurant employees (learning process like DuoLingo) Web-based application Using the web-based application, a manager can visually define all the processes in their restaurant and gamify those processes, so that employees can learn them. This significantly shortens onboarding time and increases the quality of work in the team (everyone is on the same page in terms of how things have to be done). Specifically, the web-based application provides the following functionality: • Define processes in your restaurant operation in a clear visual way. The application allows for four types of processes: 1) menu (define the process of assembling dishes and drinks) 2) operations (define any operation-related process) 3) decisions (define decisions triggered by the external events) 4) guidance (define policies and rules) • Transfer the processes from text format to visuals with the help of AI (upload text, get visuals as an output) • Choose games for the defined processes (the application suggests the games automatically based on the type of processes) • Define roles in your restaurant and assign processes to roles • Define quizzes: choose processes to learn in each quiz, define the cadence of quizzes, assign quizzes to roles • Monitor employee progress: see employee success rate and ranking Mobile application Using the mobile application an employee can learn the processes defined for them by the management in an easy and fun way. Specifically, the mobile application for restaurant employees has the following functionality: • Choose a quiz to complete and play the games inside of the quiz, therefore learning the processes defined by the management • See your progress and compare it with the progress of other restaurant employees • See process changes implemented by management and learn new processes immediately after they are inputted by the management.

While determined to fuel Latin America’s ongoing emergence of a new middle class with a fully-fledged portfolio of inclusive financial services, Aviva’s initial go-to-market concentrates on unsecured credit products for individuals and nano-businesses in Mexico. As most of the underbanked 40+ million Mexicans live in small and medium-sized towns, Aviva builds a bridge to those living in remote communities with its physical onboarding kiosks. These nano-branches provide a documentless 3-minute video onboarding for everyone in need of liquidity. Novel AI-based technology, including natural language processing, allows Aviva to match customers’ spoken word to the fields of a comprehensive real-time credit application. Transforming speech to text and inferring emotions and personality from the visual layer of the application video gives Aviva an edge in scoring thin-file customers. Leveraging these novel risk models, Aviva aims to provide the lowest interest rates available to today’s underserved.

Jan 19, 2022
Hour25.ai is improving emotional resilience to social networks in real-time. People’s success (in work, family, and any life goal) is fundamentally affected by the increasing problem to focus. Our mission is to improve people’s ability to handle powerful social networks and other AI-based services (retail, news, etc.). Hour25.ai has developed and tested a unique mobile platform that increases focus by detecting for the user, in real-time, when his emotional state has driven him into the ‘hands’ of social networks. Then - help the employee boost attention using behavioral interventions targeted by these focus-negative feelings. For example, when they validate that they’re bored, we provide them with a psychological exercise (video, quiz, short reading, music, etc.) to shift their focus towards where their focus lane is. For example - the boredom quiz asks them questions that help them understand the core reasons they are bored, which pulls them out of the unwanted emotional situation. AS a B2B company - we're targeted to provide a solution to many employers seeking to increase precious employees' productivity while ensuring they are happy. Hour25.ai has the key to giving back one hour a day, solving this $650B problem.

We are a technology product company, specializing in employment analytics. We use state of art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning and AI algorithms to process large-scale data to help our clients decide and prioritize programs, markets and investment decisions. The name of our company is inspired by the bird species - Canaries. Canaries have been extensively used in research to study neurogenesis, or the birth of new neurons in the adult brain, and also for basic research in order to understand how songbirds encode and produce song. Thus, canaries have served as model species for discovering how the vertebrate brain learns, consolidates memories, and recalls coordinated motor movements. This is a good analogy for Neural networks where backpropagation represents learning, final weights represent consolidated memories, and model inference represents recalling motor movements. We are proud to be an AI-first company. The name of our company is inspired by the bird species - Canaries.

The Business We are an AI aided research data management firm. We help researchers develop, disseminate, find and digest cutting edge research using AI tools and computer networks. On our website, and connected ecosystem, researchers can e-publish and collaborate, search and discover, and manage research data. We also help non-profit companies, Universities, for-profit publishing companies, Government agencies and Industry groups with enhancing their digital repositories of research data so that these repositories better serve their research customers. Target Market Our end users are researchers and authors looking for innovative software tools to develop, find and promote their research. We serve our customers either individually (BtoC) or through enterprises (BtoB) that serve researchers. The Business Opportunity The proliferation of research digital data has created a demand for AI software tools that enable a researcher to more easily find, evaluate, promote and collaborate on research data. Open and smart online access to research facilitates knowledge discovery and sharing. Our Competitive Advantage We are founded by researchers who understand and participate in the market we serve. Our founders are researchers in Academia and Government, and technical and computational experience informs the software tools we offer and the data we host. We understand what our customers need and how to develop and deliver it to them. Our Divisions We operate through three (3) divisions. First, we operate our SaaS website. Second, we develop and license our software tools to connected research repositories, who in turn make their content available to our customers. Finally, we provide science technology consulting services informed by research. Sales and Marketing Channels We are using online channels, email marketing and social media to recruit users and scale content. Our founders use their following to promote our business to their colleagues. Financial Summary We have begun earning revenues and operate a web portal which is scaling and has over 15,000 registered users since its launch almost 2 years ago. We are beginning to charge subscription fees for use of our AI tools. Our core addressable market (University based researchers) for academic publishing is $25 billion annually. This does not include the market for individual or non-University subscribers or the market for add on services, such as scientific recruiting and advertising. It also does not include the market for developing and selling software tools to data providers that service researchers. It also does not include the market for science technology consulting services. Our total addressable market is estimated at $50 billion annually. Funding We are currently seeking seed funding of $2.5 million to build internal resources for software development, sales and marketing and additional administration support.

Everyone seems to be an expert on their social media accounts, and expertise is tied to some predictive power, right? Wrong. Polling companies miss election results by enormous margins. Financial "gurus" say XYZ will go up, and you end up losing your life savings. Sports commentators give a complete explanation why Team A will defeat Team B, and after the match, they explain with a straight face why Team A didn't stand a chance. Well, but after that they lose all their prestige and followers, right? Wrong again. Nobody keeps a track record, and in the current state of affairs, fame and merit don't necessarily correlate. So, who are the best at predicting their own field of expertise? It is impossible to know...until now. Join Halley to find the best predictions and learn together who are the real Gurus on your subject of choice.

Hometown Workforce Logo
Hometown Workforce
1-10
Mar 30, 2022
Imagine an A.I assistant that can find someone qualified to take care of your problem, get an estimated price for the service, and give you a few start times to choose from. Does this conversation sound familiar? I have this problem at ZIP code 39531. Can you fix it, when can you fix it and how much will it cost? Our A.I replies to that request with answers to each part. Example service request: “39531 toilet won’t flush” Example A.I assistant reply: Service Name: Toilet Repair (Won't Flush, Running, Clog) Estimated Price: $85 Soonest Arrival Window: 10/18 Thur, 9:00am-10:00am Click here to order this service Or find similar services here Hometown Workforce is like DoorDash for services with an A.I assistant that helps consumers hire service providers. These people create a series of service listings on our marketplace. Consumers then pick the service they need, choose an available start time, and deposit 1% of the estimated total down. This 1% contractually obligates the person to show up on time and complete the work for the price estimated. If they don't they risk losing access to the platform. This order process also runs the person's entire business. It manages payments, provides jobs, and schedules those jobs. All the person has to do is show up on time and do a good job. In exchange for this commitment to being honest and reliable, our tech can turn the skills of virtually anyone regardless of race, gender, background, or circumstances into a successful business. Angie's List and all the other lead gen sites do one thing. They connect consumers with contractors. They can't schedule the job. They can't verify the quality of work and they can't verify the price is fair. Without all 4 you can't effectively help consumers complete jobs. We take care of all 4 and more! MISSION STATEMENT: Our mission is to help eliminate poverty by turning people's skills into successful businesses. This is the first true solution to poverty I'm aware of. It's also perhaps the most powerful tool ever conceived for incentivizing people to be honest and reliable. HOW OUR TECHNOLOGY WORKS: What makes this platform truly revolutionary is the series of listings people create on our marketplace. These listings pre-price and pre-timed their individual services. Since each service is pre-priced we can standardize prices which eliminates price gouging, it also ensures the person gets paid. Since each service is pre-timed the consumer can look at the person's work calendar and see all the available openings with enough hours to accommodate the specific job. Then they pick one which ensures the person shows up on time. It also provides them with jobs and manages every hour of every day. It tells the person where to go, what to do, and when to be there. There are billions of ordinary people who have skills people will pay for. They just have no idea how to turn those skills into a successful business. That’s exactly what Hometown Workforce does! We also have a training division that can provide people with skills. You choose a trade, we partner you with an instructor who will create listings specific to your career path. Consumers order those services and after you learn to do the work on the job. All the listings are turned over to you and instantly you have a successful business.

For decades, technology has been transforming the way businesses function, setting new benchmarks when it comes to efficiency and scalability. But while we can go on and on about what technology has done, one thing is for certain. It has left gaps. Small businesses and frontline workers (the 99%) have been left out of digital transformation plans for decades now. Today, they remain a major roadblock to creating truly digitized value chains. They are the parts of a large enterprise's workflow that remain manual and have no transparency whatsoever. Nothing is stopping small businesses and the working population from adopting technology if its value is clear and it's easy to use. It’s time for the next wave of digital transformation, one that extends the reach of technology from back offices of big businesses to the frontlines, and perhaps even to every connected partner, no matter how small. That’s what we are up to at Fieldmobi. We’re focused on enabling the next evolution of ERP by digitizing the 99% and connecting them to enterprise workflows, making truly and fully connected value chains a reality. To do this we have 3 product lines, all on the same platform, using the same app: Fieldmobi Frontline - A direct line to the teams, resources and operations at the frontlines of your business. It can be used in isolation or connected to an existing ERP system to extend it to the field. Fieldmobi First ERP - A stepping stone ERP system designed for undigitized businesses that have never used an ERP system. It uses Frontline to structure the master information required to set up an ERP system and comes with an AI-based ERP consultant to help with implementation. Fieldmobi ERP Extensions - Designed for large enterprises or industry partners, these are the truly verticalizable parts of our platform, allowing organizations to create a set of customized applications, connect it to its existing ERP system and roll it out to a network of vendors, partners and customers. We recently launched Fieldmobi Smart Notes on Product Hunt (We were the 5th Product of the Day and 10th of the Week!). Fieldmobi Smart Notes is a simple tool that any team can use. They just need to download the Fieldmobi app and create a team (just like a Whatsapp group) and the team can start sending in messages with images (that get converted to text), audio clips and Smart Tags for amounts, categories and keywords. It all gets auto-classified, geotagged, becomes searchable and can be viewed as a table, on a map or downloaded to excel as a report. (Imagine Whatsapp group chats disguised as a powerful field team management platform).

Agrobit develops digital farming solutions based on imaging (smartphone, drones) to help farmers getting better decision in agro-inputs management. The flagship product is the mobile app iAgro, the first quantitative Decision Support System to optimize pesticide treatments and digitize crops (digital twin) quickly and easily just using a smartphone. The competitive advantages are to provide information unobtainable from other technologies (field sensors, satellites), the use of proprietary AR, AI and computer vision algorithms and the possibility to reach a huge number of users that cannot make high investments but are the majority in Europe (small/medium farms). The app uses AR to 3D-scan plants (tree crops) and in-cloud AI and computer vision algorithms to re-create the 3D model (digital twin) of the scanned plant, in order to calculate its biometrics (canopy thickness, height, volume), vigor parameter (LAI) and field parameters (LWA, TRV). Finally, a mathematical model estimates the correct pesticide doses to be distributed.

We are applying AI to food robotics and quick-service restaurants through our operating subsidiaries. Through our giveback model, we will address food insecurity. Kossel is addressing two problems. Americans spend $30 billion annually on fast food sandwiches that lack organic certification, suffer from mediocre quality, and feature inconsistently proportioned ingredients, exposing themselves to a high risk of people-to-food bacterial and viral cross-contamination. The 34,151 U.S. quick-service sandwich restaurants are too labor intensive and have high turnover. Foodservice and production employ the fourth-largest number of people and suffer from the most significant labor shortage.

API - Beepo APIs can be integrated into third-party centralized/web2 existing social media such as the Meta Apps (Facebook) and others. This would allow users from these existing platforms easily make crypto transactions 3. Inchat-transactions - Beepo allows its users to make quick transactions directly from the dm without switching to the wallet section 4. E-commerce - Beepo also integrates a professional feature for small-scale business owners which allows them to create a sales catalog that they display and sell products easily. 5.

Beepo is trying to solve 1. Privacy issues around social media usage: The vast stockpiles of personal data that social media platforms gather and hold are susceptible to hacking, scraping, and data breaches, the at-risk data might include location information, health information, religious identification, sexual orientation, face recognition imaging, private communications, and personal photographs, among others. 2. Biased and Centralised Censorship: The regulatory ideas for social media and technology companies are motivated by political concerns. Since they are based on the choice of a private organization or government body and not that of the broader people, these restrictions on free expression are often seen to be prejudiced. 3. Complexity: Making crypto-based and cross-border transaction is very complex for people who are eventually new to the system and how it works, the need to use multiple crypto wallets to execute certain task and the complexity in handling certain crypto wallets increases the chances of making errors in transactions.

REALTIME PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS FOR HEDGE FUNDS: Simple answers to high-value questions. Investors seek fundamental insights into the companies they invest in. They can gain a competitive advantage by licensing proprietary information that only a limited number of funds can find and afford. To build these high-value datasets, we strategically place cameras/sensors to collect images/data of business activities that map to key company performance insights. We can process that data with AI (Computer Vision/Machine Learning) to generate unique insights into high-value questions for Hedge Funds and other asset managers. Specifically, in our first two datasets we collect highly accurate and precise counts of every vehicle (Model Y or now Cybertruck) produced by Tesla at the GigaTexas factory and all four models (S, X, 3, and Y) vehicles produced at Fremont, CA. We license this data to hedge funds seeking an information advantage for trading equities. Investors call this type of information Alternative Data or External Data because it's not published or directly sanctioned by the companies we observe. It is often built through innovative technology from unconventional sources. As we scale up, we expect to have numerous high-valued locations. We are hiring in several areas, DM me directly.

Feb 7, 2022
E-CONCIERGE 2.0 is our innovative solution aimed at modernizing the home services industry. It's an intelligent virtual assistant, designed to streamline the often complex and time-consuming processes in the home service sector, beginning with the appliance repair industry. This smart bot excels at collecting a wealth of information in a user-friendly way. Through an interactive and intuitive Q&A process, E-CONCIERGE 2.0 engages with users to understand their needs, determine the nature of their service request, and schedule an appropriate service appointment. Not only does it replace manual scheduling and dispatching, but it also automates the process of adding the necessary information to the service provider's Google contacts and workflow management application, significantly reducing administrative workloads. As impressive as E-CONCIERGE 2.0 is, it's just the beginning of our vision. We're already setting our sights on the next iteration - E-CONCIERGE AI. This advanced version is envisaged to integrate AI capabilities to offer more than just streamlining scheduling and dispatching. E-CONCIERGE AI will be a game-changer in its ability to predict potential service issues before the technician arrives. Using the power of AI, it will process the collected information, anticipate the problem, and advise the technician on the necessary parts and procedures they might need. This predictive function will dramatically speed up service delivery by eliminating unnecessary guesswork. Beyond predictive troubleshooting, E-CONCIERGE AI will also offer AI-enhanced technical support, guiding technicians through complex tasks and providing real-time solutions, equipping them to solve issues more swiftly and accurately. Our mission is more than just improving efficiency; we aim to revolutionize the experience for both customers and service providers. We envision a future where home services are reliable, effective, and user-friendly, and we are eager to lead the way in this transformative journey.

Jan 31, 2022
The global economy bears a price tag of more than $320 billion to afford the impact of burnout on high-skilled workers. This scenario comes as a result of professionals not being able to deal properly with both setting clear boundaries between personal time and work hours as well as having clarity on what (and how) they need to achieve in terms of business objectives, in addition to managing increasing notifications and distractions that come from the new ‘normal’ of remote work or hybrid workplaces, for instance, households tasks that add up to existing business responsibilities. All this results in an unhealthy work-life balance and lower personal productivity, including poor time-consistent behavior, like procrastination. From the whole group of professionals, there is one subset that presents the worst statistics. According to McKinsey, there is an estimated 165 million high-skilled freelancers and independent consultants on a part- or full-time basis, and research shows that each of them gets about 50 to 60 distractions per day on average, taking it approximately 23 minutes to regain focus every time. As a result of all these interruptions, these professionals lose around 500 hours of productive time per person per year; time that could be used to improve their work-life balance, or grow their businesses if they wanted to. In order to avoid this problem, digital workers currently use some well-known best practices recommended by productivity experts, like using phone’s ‘Do not disturb’ or airplane modes to manage their notifications, or to-do lists to keep track of their tasks and finish work on time; nevertheless, these tools don’t solve the core issue of decreased workers’ well-being nor manage to maximize their time and energy levels to create a better work-life balance. For instance, ‘Do not disturb’ mode silences mobile phones at the expense of missing relevant calls (i.e. from their most important client), whereas to-do lists only provide visibility on a set of tasks that need to be tackled or delivered within a certain timeframe; however, they fell short on providing clarity on whether these tasks are realistic and achievable, or what necessary steps are required in order to help users remain time consistent. Additionally, this problem becomes greater when we consider that these high-skilled professionals are solopreneurs who don’t have a team to rely on or to use as support to brainstorm how best to approach their challenges, adding a layer of ‘loneliness’ to their work routines. Based on the previously mentioned problematic scenario in combination with the feedback we have collected during our interviews with more than 300 high-skilled professionals, we decided to work on Silentus, a productivity app that helps high-skilled freelancers not only setup a focus mode that keeps them on top of their most relevant notifications (by creating allowed lists for both contacts and apps) but also beat procrastination (by providing them with a smart ML-enabled tool to get visibility on how to achieve their goals). Take the example of a freelance copywriter. On a given day she needs to deliver some articles for three different clients. Depending on her schedule, she can create three allowed lists with names of stakeholders for each of her clients and turn them on and off accordingly. Moreover, when she’s working on client A’s assignment (for instance, deliver a 50,000-word blog article), she can use Silentus’ ML tool to forecast her success rate on completing this task on-time and in-full. The way this smart tool works is as follows: our freelance copywriter enters few parameters like deadline, number of words, or client linked to this task. Based on her past activity, our tool forecasts her success rate. If this rate is below certain threshold, Silentus will recommend her different options to increase her success percentage; for example, extending the deadline, splitting the task into smaller chunks, etc. As a result of using Silentus, our freelancer benefits not only from gaining extra time by working on focus mode but also from getting clarity and time consistency when working towards clear and achievable goals, improving her work-life balance and well-being. Furthermore, she could use the time regained during her workday to grow her business (bill additional hours) or for leisure (more quality time with friends and family). Four aspects are part of Silentus’ competitive advantage. First, our AI/ML personal assistant that allows our users to keep their business running even when they are enjoying time off or logged off from work after ‘office’ hours. Second, sense of belonging to a Community of like-minded high-skilled professionals (who share their stories and tips on both our Slack channel and online community forums), contributing to fighting the loneliness of a profession like freelancing. Third, an extra week per month (equivalent to regain 500 hours per year) that workers can use for leisure or to create additional income (more hours to bill). Fourth, the ability to build upon new habits that will be instrumental to increase their personal productivity as well as their well-being.

Here's how: Integrated Sporting Goods: At the heart of our ecosystem lies our state-of-the-art sporting goods, like the ROOKIE Basketball. These aren't your run-of-the-mill equipment; each piece is embedded with advanced sensors that collect data as you play. Data Collection & Transfer: As users engage with our sporting goods, every movement, every score, and every skillful maneuver is captured.

The AI model identifies patterns, assesses the skill level, and verifies the authenticity of the gameplay. Tokenization & Rewards: Post-analysis, the authenticated data is directed to our distributed ledger. This ledger validates the transactions and, based on the player's performance, assigns rewards in the form of tokens. The better you play, the more you earn! Engaging Mobile UI: Players can track their performance, redeem their tokens, and even challenge others via the ROOKIE mobile app. It's not just about playing; it's about being part of a global community of sports enthusiasts. Multiple Play Modes: Whether you're an individual looking to practice (Free Play), wanting a head-to-head challenge (Quick Match), or teaming up for a group game (Teams), ROOKIE has a mode for you. Each mode offers unique rewards, ensuring players are continually engaged and motivated. Global Connectivity: With ROOKIE, geographical barriers are a thing of the past. Players from different corners of the world can connect, compete, and collaborate. Incentivization: Beyond the thrill of the game, players are incentivized for the time, energy, and passion they invest in sports. From skill points to PoS tokens, every achievement is recognized and rewarded. Community Building & Engagement: The ROOKIE ecosystem is more than just a product; it's a movement. From our podcast featuring NBA stars to strategic partnerships with industry leaders, we're fostering a global community bound by their love for sports.

Did you know that 6 out of 10 digital professionals are dissatisfied with their current position? This issue not only has an emotional impact on the professional, but it also costs companies up to 400% of the value of a monthly payroll due to low productivity and attrition. What if I told you there was an answer? Each individual has a distinct talent, and at each stage of their professional career, there is a job opportunity in which they can shine, and work happiness is essential to achieving it. We are Neomadas, the first HR Tech StartUp that improves work environments by connecting digital professionals with companies where they can shine through job happiness recruitment and selection. We developed a B2C2B business model to make this project scalable: Our ambition is to be the manager of Latam's largest digital rockstar community. To accomplish this, we focus not only on providing good support during the selection process, but also on being available to them throughout their working lives, providing them with tools for self-awareness, professional and personal development, and all from our platform. Digital interaction will provide us with enough information to identify talent in an unobtrusive manner, allowing us to bring you job opportunities at the right time throughout your professional life. Unlike other companies and platforms around the world, such as Talently, Torre, Multiplica, or Michael Page, Neómadas has online tests that are taken anonymously to the leader and the close environment of the vacancy, the results of which are crossed by our AI with the information of our community, allowing us to have a more accurate person-organization affinity. Likewise, we are the first to put job happiness at the center of the Recruitment and Selection process. We are a team of three founders: Marco Tito, a digital growth specialist with experience in StartUps such as Cabify; Sarah Cárdenas, a psychologist specialized in IT recruitment in StartUps such as Multiplica and Crehana; and Christian Revilla, a software specialist and entrepreneur of digital transformation agencies in Peru that have invoiced more than $ 1M (USD). And together, we will create a world in which everyone, regardless of background, ethnicity, gender, or age, sees work as a second home.

Mar 23, 2022
Where we are currently: We currently have 17,000 popular Movie and TV Show quizzes with more than 615,797 MCQs combined, which you can find through the search bar. We are adding 700 new movies daily. Scorecards will be saved forever for users. They can invite others to take the quiz by sharing the quiz link. We have almost 90 percent of all popular movies and tv shows going back to the 1990s, and in the coming months, we will have everything that's ever released since the beginning of cinema. You can also request unavailable titles, and we will make them available in 2 weeks for now and very soon, within 24 hours or even instantly. The elevator pitch: We are a social platform that tests users' mastery of their favorite topics through AI-powered quizzes and spins out a cute scorecard that you can share on your social media. It will then create exclusive clubs of five people each from the top scorers, where they meet on a 35-minute zoom call and compete for cash prizes for sharing the most exciting stories or prompts related to the topic. Afterward, every participant rates the other four based on how much they enjoyed listening and interacting with them. Business Model: If 10,000 people took our quiz for Titanic and 1,000 participated via Zoom, we showed an ad before every quiz and zoom call. That's 11,000 ad views, so if we make a dollar from every ad view, it's $11,000. We distribute 80% of it equally to the top 10 finalists and keep the 20% to us.

Rosso Logo

Jul 22, 2022
Rosso is a startup dedicated to eliminating the blood shortage crisis in Italy by serving as a connective tissue in the blood supply chain, collaborating with schools, universities, donor associations, and hospitals. Our primary goal is to reduce patient wait times by increasing the number of donors, particularly young donors. Currently, Generation Z is not donating blood significantly; the average donor age is 45, while donation is allowed from 18 to 65 years old. Through innovative social media campaigns and a booking platform, we raise awareness among young people, encouraging them to book donations at nearby centers and providing instant chat access with hematologists to address their concerns. For companies, we offer a welfare service and sustainability membership that engages employees in health prevention and blood donation. We organize awareness webinars, donation days, and monitor employee health, providing impact reports. These activities are included in the company's sustainability report and contribute to B-Corp certification. Our third pillar involves management software for hospitals. We offer a plugin that optimizes blood stock management in hospitals by managing donor portfolios and the relationships between donors, associations, and hospitals. By knowing the blood stock levels, we can send automatic recalls or alerts when blood is needed and there are donors nearby ready to donate. With the help of AI, we can predict future blood stock needs, required blood types, and the timing of potential shortages.

The burden of paperwork consumes over 50-70% of a healthcare professional's time, meaning that for every minute spent with a patient, they must allocate at least another minute to paperwork. These tasks do not add value and ultimately lead to a reduced number of patients being seen. As a result, healthcare professionals may feel demotivated, and the decrease in patient volume can result in reduced income or the need to hire additional professionals. CoeurWay is a health technology startup that specializes in developing an AI-based software platform. Their platform seamlessly integrates with healthcare professionals' existing software and offers advanced analysis tools to optimize healthcare through technology. Specifically, here are their key features: Automated generation of standardized notes using AI, reducing administrative tasks for healthcare professionals. AI-assisted prefilling of mandatory forms, minimizing administrative burdens for professionals. AI-powered recommendations for healthy lifestyle habits and healthcare prescriptions, fostering a sustainable healthcare system. A centralized platform that consolidates various existing healthcare applications while incorporating AI capabilities into their software. Based on our clinical test results, we anticipate a significant reduction of 90% in paperwork through the use of this platform.

noc™ Logo
noc™
1-10
Jul 7, 2022
Knock Technology creates and operates SaaS products for remote work productivity. The company's first product is noc™ - a video communication tool, scientifically designed to minimise the cognitive effort of context-switching between tasks and calls. By minimising the cognitive load on the human brain, users are able to communicate more naturally whilst maintaining focus on their current task. This results in reduced mental exhaustion ("Zoom fatigue"), fewer incidences of miscommunication, improved productivity, innovation, and staff retention. The product also uses natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to summarise conversational content and deliver live, unbiased operational data to business leaders. After a call, the NLP transcript is compressed by the AI into a bullet-pointed summary of the conversation. For larger companies, the AI compresses all conversation data to present a live operational dashboard to senior leadership, helping them make more informed decisions. The company has been awarded grant funding by the EU's Regional Development Fund and Innovate UK's Transformative Technologies Fund for research into the effects of remote communication on mental health, productivity and innovation, as well as its contribution towards net zero carbon emissions by reducing the demand for travel. The product was created by thought-leading user experience designers, MBA graduates and PhD neuroscientists from Cranfield University, The University of Bristol and University College London to fill a gap in the remote comms market for instant, casual communication with distant colleagues. It uses a unique peer-to-peer network architecture that bypasses data centres for a faster, clearer and more energy-efficient connection.

Beagle Network Logo
Beagle Network

Aug 8, 2022
E-commerce growth rates and margins are under pressure, so brands need new ways for "efficient growth" with fewer employees and smaller budgets. In order to grow, they must win conversions on their existing customer traffic. Unfortunately, most e-tailers are uncompetitive in "converting customers" because they have limited IT resources, insufficient know-how and small datasets. As a result, Brands with $50M-$1B in sales are missing out on $300 Billion in lost sales opportunities. Beagle Network innovated AI-supervised mini-robots that predict a buyer's intent with just a few clicks and customize the product details, user interface, and copy in real-time, making it a first-of-its-kind product in the market. The mini-robots also learn from a large data pool by experimenting with multiple clients at the same time, which solves the cold-start problem and quickly delivers results. Beagle Network is a team of Stanford graduates, Case Western PhDs, and AI Unicorn alums on their way to enabling millions of people with shopping innovations across all eCommerce touchpoints.

Aug 12, 2022
E-commerce growth rates and margins are under pressure, so brands need new ways for "efficient growth" with fewer employees and smaller budgets. In order to grow, they must win conversions on their existing customer traffic. Unfortunately, most e-tailers are uncompetitive in "converting customers" because they have limited IT resources, insufficient know-how and small datasets. As a result, Brands with $50M-$1B in sales are missing out on $300 Billion in lost sales opportunities. Glov innovated AI-supervised mini-robots that predict a buyer's intent with just a few clicks and customize the product details, user interface, and copy in real-time, making it a first-of-its-kind product in the market. The mini-robots also learn from a large data pool by experimenting with multiple clients at the same time, which solves the cold-start problem and quickly delivers results. Glov is a team of Stanford graduates, Case Western PhDs, and AI Unicorn alums on their way to enabling millions of people with shopping innovations across all eCommerce touchpoints.

MobilityZ Health is an advanced digital health SAAS platform designed to assist orthopedic specialists in screening, diagnosing, and monitoring patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. Our proprietary software offers clinical decision support. The global market for MSK injuries is valued at a staggering 381 billion dollars, with an annual incidence rate of 129 billion cases annually. Despite these numbers, fewer specialists are available to provide care, and the number of patients far exceeds their management capacity. The lack of a proper triage mechanism has led to an alarming rate of physician burnout. Furthermore, delay in access to care can cause permanent damage and, in the worst cases, disability. Our AIML models will potentially function as Software as a Medical Device (SAMD).

Zeeh Africa Logo
Zeeh Africa

Aug 22, 2022
Zeeh Africa is a financial technology startup that aims to drive financial inclusion across Africa. We do this by providing a secure and user-friendly platform that simplifies financial management and streamlines credit applications for individuals and businesses. Our platform connects users to trusted identities, consumer financial data, and credit scoring/analytics, all with a single secure ID. The problem we are solving is the lack of reliable infrastructure and data analytics that makes it difficult for financial services businesses to access user identities and financial data in real time. This makes customer onboarding slower, less efficient, and more expensive. It also makes it harder for consumers to manage their day-to-day finances and financial data, and for small and medium-sized enterprises in Nigeria to make informed decisions based on data rather than intuition. To solve this problem, we offer a pay-as-you-use business-to-business model where clients fund their wallets and pay per API call, with each API endpoint having a predefined fee. We also have a consumer freemium model, with a subscription base (in the pipeline) where clients can subscribe to a volume of API calls capped at a limit. The market we operate in is the financial technology industry in Africa, which is a rapidly growing market with a lot of potential. The size of the market is difficult to quantify, but we believe there is a significant demand for our product and services across Africa. Our opportunity for growth and scalability lies in our ability to continuously innovate and differentiate our products and services. This could include offering unique features or functionality, providing superior customer service, or offering competitive pricing. We also plan to expand beyond our current scope by exploring new industries and technologies that can benefit from our platform.

Leela Life is on a mission to help people across the world have a peaceful and joyful life A lot of people across the world, especially the top ones that are highly educated, skilled, creative, significantly accomplished, and demonstrate exceptional leadership and influence increasingly find themselves assessing their priorities in life & looking for a joyful, less conflict-ridden, and healthier life. Many of them have been exposed to Yoga, Meditation, and getting to know about Ayurveda, and have experienced the benefit of it. However, there is a whole world of practical Indic solutions that they are still unaware of. India’s ancient Knowledge has got deep & significant insights across a vast array of areas such as Health, Mindfulness, Food, Intimacy, Personal Care, Nature, Spirituality, Art, etc. meant to achieve a peaceful and joyful life. Given the vast range present in the Indic knowledge system and many different specialists (institutions/companies/individual experts/gurus) that espouse them, it's difficult for them to discover relevant solutions for their holistic wellbeing. Hence there is an increasing demand for, a knowledge-led curated marketplace that enables people across the world to discover, choose and integrate practical, relevant, and holistic Indic wellbeing solutions and apply them in their daily life. Leela Life’s Vision is to make Indic wellbeing knowledge the transformative difference in global health. Unlike modern healthcare that solves immediate health problems, Leela Life strives to achieve this vision by enhancing human capacity through personalized & holistic life routines that incorporate various products, practices & insights from Indic knowledge. Leela Life's starting proposition is a global online marketplace for wellbeing solutions arising from timeless Indic knowledge.

Given the lack of professionalism in the sector, where cost control has become the top priority, and the absence of comprehensive AI-powered digital tools like Prezo to streamline manual processes and reduce time, we have developed an application that addresses all the needs for efficient management. Prezo is a highly intuitive and accessible tool that empowers professionals to carry out their tasks digitally, reduce errors, simplify administrative tasks, save time, and boost business performance. Currently, there is no software that combines all the functionalities offered by Prezo, which additionally features an OCR module developed with advanced Artificial Intelligence surpassing any competitor. This is why Prezo stands as the sole solution for efficient hospitality management."

TerraNexum Logo

Jul 18, 2022
TerraNexum is developing a quantum geospatial platform to help companies and governments optimize their supply webs with an AI-driven approach to geospatial network dynamics. Enabling greater sustainability, security, and resilience, leading to greater abundance and prosperity within our planet's means. Because when we can see it on a map, we can believe in it. And take steps to make it happen. Gone are the days of thinking only of supply chains and isolated lifecycle assessments (LCAs) to accomplish our goals of a sustainable, secure, and resilient future. Supply webs must be our next level of analytics for understanding and doing purposeful business within complex systems. Far greater efficiencies than any isolated chain can achieve could be the result, instead of supply chain failures occurring as the result of unknown bottlenecks in energy and resource flows. This future of geospatial analytics, offering near real-time monitoring and optimization of supply webs, will be made possible by our Quantum Geospatial Optimizer (QGO). We are proud participants of Google for Startups Cloud Program - AI, NVIDIA Inception, Microsoft Startups Hub, and AWS Activate, enabling us to be on target to launch QGO in early 2024. With AI for geospatial data ingest/processing/optimization readiness as well as quantum optimization on hardware-accelerated simulators. The latter allows us to perform supply web optimization at low cost today until true quantum computers are ready tomorrow. QGO will deliver solutions in the form of graph networks, each of the optimal supply web characteristics meeting the customer's inquiry. Near real-time data feeds by API will be a future target. We are digital enablers of ecosystem restoration. Grounding our supply webs on the most resilient and sustainable network ever to evolve. Supporting efforts not only in climate tech and carbon tech, but nature tech. Because the rest of nature is sustainable. Human systems aren't there yet today. But tomorrow can be different. We're in the business of making that future possible.

The most significant elements that we check are as follows: the most frequent key words in the whole website and each webpage separately (whether they appear in the title, description, alt, url, h1-h6 attributes) the amount of the content (key words in the whole website, webpages, in relation to html, etc.) popularity of webpages in the social media (useful e.g. during research of the competition’s articles) SEO technical aspects (title, description, h1...h6 elements, alt) SSL certificates when it is valid and when it expires image optimization on-site link correctness verification On the basis of all elements we determine the original Seodity Rank, with the usage of which one can sort webpages. Plan for the future (works have already been initiated): backlinks automatic competition verification on the basis of the Google search results (analysis of each competitive webpage separately and drawing conclusions + prompts) white-label report adjusted to the Client’s audit

There are 44 million SMEs in Africa, and the vast majority lack stock management solutions, relying on pen and notebooks to control the stock of their products and register their sales. Tech options cater to mid and high end businesses and are very complex for SMEs use cases. This brings a lot of inefficiencies to these SMEs, and susceptibility to product loss and theft. We have 2 main products: Digital Manager at https://digital.jon-ai.com Digital Manager is a Small Business Management Software that can help small businesses manage their business and get important information such as profit and cash flow so they can keep operating and growing their businesses. It works by having the business owner give information on his fixed costs, his products, stock, price and costs, and registering ever sale. Most businesses in developing nations such as in Africa, a micro business that need this software to keep in business and we are doing our best to promote it and keep improving it. This Software uses AI to register sales, and to give actionable advice to business owners. Invoicing Software at https://apps.jon-ai.com Jon AI brings Apps, a set of Stock Management and Invoicing solutions catering to SMEs and starting at as low as $5 USD month. Our software runs both online and offline, and helps businesses know exactly what their stock for each of their products and product categories is. The stock is then linked to the invoicing. Our solution offers easy stock management for any kind of small business, from Bottle stores, convenience stores, grocery shops, car shops, car parts shops, clothing stores and more. Our business integrates well with existing hardware (thermal receipt printers), but we also want to procure ideal hardware and supply to SMEs at atractive prices, for instance: bluetooth thermal printers, label printers, and others. We will become the number one supplier of both the software and hardware for SMEs. In our products we use AI to make the experience more intuitive (example getting information on sales for a particular period: "how many tyres did I sell in november?"), and plan on building on-device AI for all solutions we offer. We are an African Software, Hardware and AI company actively looking for funding.

What makes the Shopazhub innovation unique, is the fact that these tools are provided to the merchant, and also in a Marketplace setting so that they don't need to bother about driving traffic. traffic naturally troops to the platform, while the merchant is left to do one thing that really matters, which is providing shoppers with amazing deals that will make them always come back to their storefront anything they return to the Shopazhub marketplace. We provide our dearly esteemed customers with tailor-made online shopping solutions that enable them to get the best deals and are assured of quality products. Part of the solution we offer our customer is the payment option of buying now and spreading the payment in flexible installments, hence enabling them to pay comfortably. We also have the #BuyNowPayLater payment option. We also believe that business is a big tool meant to assist the less privileged in society to have a chance at life, to this event, for every item purchased on our online store, 2% of whatever the customer paid is donated to charity. With a special interest in assisting kids in slum locations to get back to school. Why shop elsewhere when you can shop in our store, and 2% of the money you paid is dedicated to charity, talk of using one stone to kill two birds. ShopazHub NG .... Engage More!! Sell Faster!!!

Traditional payments under $1 are usually very costly, since credit card fees charge a minimum of $0.30 per transaction. With the Lightning Network, this fee becomes negligible and is the technology that is powering micropay. Users don’t pay with credit cards or with US dollars, but instead pay a Lightning Invoice, available to pay through Cashapp, [strike.me](http://strike.me) or by having your own Lightning Node.

Jul 4, 2022
Our app introduces a paradigm shift in the market by providing a tool that systematically analyzes household energy usage. Users will provide input data through a brief onboarding questionnaire, which will take no more than 2 minutes to complete and includes simple questions. By adopting probabilistic, statistical, and artificial intelligence methods corroborated with our extensive know-how in the energy field, Renergia provides a customized household energy balance for its users, precisely estimating (2-7% error) their monthly and annual energy costs and savings potential (both electricity and heating). This plan will highlight the aggregate energy efficiency potential, quantified in local currency, and describes each proposed measure, which may include appliance replacement with energy-efficient equipment, household thermal insulation, migration to LED lighting, implementing of smart sockets, and installing photovoltaic systems which at the end of the day gives you all the information you need to make the best decisions about your both consumption and the type and nature of the energy used. At the heart of our product lies the SolarSensei intelligent photovoltaic system designer, which utilizes information such as the household's usable area, yearly electricity consumption, and the city of residence to automatically determine (one click distance from the complete solution) a suitable PV solution for our users. We translate the concepts of energy efficiency and sustainability into tangible benefits using local currency. We understand that consumers are more likely to make efforts if they see immediate material advantages. In our app, we display consumption and savings information in local currency and also provide attractive incentives in the form of CO2 emissions reduction (measured in kilograms). Many individuals are aware of the problem but lack knowledge about how to solve it. Our solution acts as a one-stop-shop concept (awareness of the problem - problem solutions - offering products in accordance, with our partners - installing services, through our partners - financing solutions, through our partners), offering an innovative approach for beginners in this field. Our revenue streams emerge from Intermediating PV systems projects, Intermediating green loans, Intermediating green home appliances sales be charging a 5% referral commission, CSR budgets - delivery of sustainability reports for corporate clients to meet ESG requirements.

DigiCARE Realized

Jun 1, 2022
DigiCARE Realized is an emerging AI-technology firm commercializing evidence-based solutions to modernize care for complex brain disease through decision intelligence in early detection and care management. Our initial focus is in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) where we seek to realize equitable, accessible, and patient-centered care. We collaborate with health systems to deliver routine brain care for our growing, aging population. DigiCARE Realized offers an AI-enabled platform for delivering decision intelligence to support proactive care in ADRD. Machine learning advancements, like decision intelligence, automate processing of vast data sources to deliver faster, actionable insights for providers. Our flagship product is based on a core principle that if you can measure it, you can manage it. Early detection offers the opportunity for timely diagnosis leading to more proactive care. We aim to develop and curate care management solutions. Powered by machine learning, our software provides passive ADRD detection with ~80% performance accuracy for 1- and 3-year prediction horizons. It combs through routinely-collected data found in patient health records to sort through structured and unstructured data. Our flagship product can help detect early-stage ADRD in all patients, regardless of what language they speak, how little time their provider has, or what kind of screening approach is selected that day. When health systems can detect early-stage ADRD in patients, they can give them better care. Providers can offer interventions sooner, they can prevent hospital readmissions, and they can accelerate participation in clinical trials.

SendEngage is an AI-driven Sales Automation Platform designed for small teams to engage a broad audience through personalized one-to-one emails. By utilizing our proven system, B2B companies can swiftly amplify lead generation, boost revenue, and reduce customer acquisition costs. With the capability to connect unlimited corporate email accounts and the advantage of our inbox rotation, customers can effortlessly scale their outreach initiatives while ensuring optimal deliverability. Our campaign sequencer offers features like A/B testing, single-thread automated follow-ups, unlimited follow-up steps, variable inserts, and the automatic exclusion of prospects once they respond. When prospects reply across multiple inboxes, we consolidate these responses in our Engagement section. Our AI analyzes email replies and categorizes them based on the level of interest. Low-value responses can be auto-discarded, and the respective contacts can be blocked from future communications. Conversely, high-value responses are automatically directed to the sales team for further action. Our system operates on a usage-based model, accommodating unlimited contact storage, inbox connections, and users.

Jun 20, 2022
Our AI solution is a valuable instrument in the fight against fraudulent activities in the marketing sector. It is founded on advanced algorithms and technologies and is trained on extensive datasets, setting it apart from antiquated methods and algorithms commonly employed in this field. One of the primary merits of our product is its capability to uncover hidden connections, analyze multiple factors, and classify fraudulent behavior. In contrast to conventional algorithms, our system not only considers the fundamental fraud indicators but is also adept at recognizing unusual patterns that may go unnoticed by standard fraud detection methods. It is developed with the aid of a large number of parameters that we take into account in our datasets. Thanks to the utilization of advanced machine learning methods, our models possess the ability to adapt and enhance their efficiency with each new dataset. As data is automatically collected, the system becomes more accurate and effective in preventing fraudulent activities. Additionally, we provide the option to integrate our solution into existing client systems and infrastructure to ensure maximum integration and utilization efficiency. Our product facilitates real-time analysis and monitoring, enabling swift responses to potential threats and the prevention of financial losses. Throughout the development process, we have placed special emphasis on creating an intuitive interface that allows our clients to interact seamlessly with the system and receive real-time information about potential risks. Flexibility and scalability are essential features of our product. Our system ensures the confidentiality and data protection of clients and complies with all necessary security standards and regulations of the countries with which we operate. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that our product outperforms competitors' traditional algorithms in combating fraudulent activities. Unlike manual data processing and manual fraud detection, our system is based on an automated approach, significantly increasing the efficiency and accuracy of fraud detection. The key advantages include: 1. Accuracy and Precision: AI-based anti-fraud systems rely on advanced algorithms and machine learning models to analyze vast volumes of data. This enables them to identify subtle patterns and anomalies that may be indicative of fraud, leading to improved accuracy and precision in identifying fraudulent transactions or actions. 2. Real-Time Detection: AI-based anti-fraud systems can operate in real-time, allowing for immediate identification and response to fraudulent activities. This rapid response is crucial in preventing potential losses and minimizing damage. 3. Adaptability: Machine learning algorithms can adapt and learn from new data, evolving alongside changing fraud tactics. This adaptability enhances the system's effectiveness against emerging threats and strategies. 4. Recognition of Complex Patterns: AI-based anti-fraud solutions can recognize complex patterns and correlations between different data, identifying non-obvious connections that rule-based traditional systems might miss. 5. Automated Decision-Making: AI-based anti-fraud systems can automate decision-making processes, particularly valuable in high-volume industries. This results in faster processing times and reduced operational costs. 6. Continuous Learning: Machine learning models continuously refine their understanding of normal and abnormal behavioral patterns as they process new data. This ongoing learning process enhances the system's ability to adapt to evolving fraud strategies. 7. Scalability: AI algorithms and solutions can efficiently process large volumes of data and operations, making them suitable for organizations of various sizes and industries. 8. Behavior Analysis: AI can analyze historical data to create profiles of genuine user behavior. This enables the system to detect deviations from normal behavior and identify potentially fraudulent actions. In conclusion, considering the growing volume of malicious bot traffic and constantly evolving fraudulent methods, AI is an indispensable part of successful fraud prevention. Our solution provides significant value to clients, helping them avoid financial losses, safeguard their reputation, and ensure the security of their business processes.

At Rentainance, we are in the process of developing a Prop-Tech application designed to bridge the gap between landlords, tenants, and brokers in the rental market. As existing platforms primarily focus on classified rentals, we aim to establish ourselves as an industry-first deal management platform that streamlines the entire process from initial profiling to rent payments. Utilizing our platform for deal management, we have incorporated an AI-based scoring model for tenants, known as the Rscore. This innovative scoring system assists landlords in mitigating risks while selecting tenants, and also serves as a risk and reward mechanism. A lower score results in higher rent, and vice versa, fostering transparency and accessibility in the rental market. Additionally, Rentainance is committed to addressing the issue of misleading property photos uploaded by landlords and brokers. To tackle this concern, our platform features a dedicated move-in photos section, allowing tenants to access authentic images uploaded by previous occupants. Furthermore, our platform's inbuilt deal flow manager enables brokers to effortlessly share property details and profiles, enhancing overall efficiency in the rental market. In summary, Rentainance is revolutionizing the rental industry by offering a comprehensive and transparent platform that caters to the needs of landlords, tenants, and brokers alike.

Superlative Biosciences is a biological services and therapeutics products development company. We are involved in the following: 1) Skin Cancer Therapeutics : We are using human tissue constructs, animal cancer models, image & spectroscopic molecular analysis, and AI to discover, formulate & deliver compounds into tumors to treat human skin cancer. We are seeking a partner or investor to join with us to help move the R&D program into clinical phases of development. 2) Toxicology Screening Services: Another of our projects is the use of high-throughput in vitro biological assays in the area of developmental toxicology. Initial screens will involve the use of human umbilical cord- and placental- derived stem cells in vitro which may allow your company to decrease the use of animals and the costs incurred in developmental toxicology testing. 3) Oncology Drug Testing: We are also developing human in vitro 3-dimensional multicellular systems that mimic the tumor microenvironment that may be used in the pre-clinical phase of the development of drugs, biologics, and biosimilars. These 3-D tissue constructs, that contain multiple cell types that are found in the tumor microenvironment, therefore more closely represent the dynamic conditions that are exhibited in vivo in the tissues of human subjects than that which can be observed using 2-D tissue culture systems. 4) Please see our funding campaign at Gust.com or AngelList.com: https://gust.com/companies/superlative-biosciences-corporation/dashboard https://angel.co/company/superlative-biosciences-2 5) Superlative BioSciences Also Provides Consultation On: Biologics, Biosimilars, Pharmaceuticals, In Vitro Diagnotics, Cell & Tissue Therapy, Stem Cells, and Combination Devices Regulatory Guidance The Preparation of Quality Manuals & Other Quality Documents including Change Control, Deviations, CAPA, FMEA, Trending, and Complaint Handling, FDA/GLP, FDA/GTP, FDA/QSR, FDA/GMP, ICH, EMA, CE Marking & ISO Documents Management.

BeepLife is a healthcare application using AI technology that promotes health and accelerates the connection between doctors and patients. It collects patients’ data, disease, and treatment history, which enables doctors to record and store a valuable database of their patient's history. In this way, doctors can pull up the information needed in a really quick time. The data collected will give insight to our physicians to distinguish non-emergency clients from emergency ones, so it can contribute largely to saving time for the doctors and nurses. Beeplife's AI services provide health information only and do not provide a diagnosis. The AI services respond to the information entered, and the information provided is based on risk factors and statistics, rather than a personalized assessment. The AI services are not a substitute for a medical professional, and should not be used in a medical emergency. It was founded in 2022 and is located in Toronto, Canada.

Rosso Logo

Jul 22, 2022
Rosso is a startup dedicated to eliminating the blood shortage crisis in Italy by serving as a connective tissue in the blood supply chain, collaborating with schools, universities, donor associations, and hospitals. Our primary goal is to reduce patient wait times by increasing the number of donors, particularly young donors. Currently, Generation Z is not donating blood significantly; the average donor age is 45, while donation is allowed from 18 to 65 years old. Through innovative social media campaigns and a booking platform, we raise awareness among young people, encouraging them to book donations at nearby centers and providing instant chat access with hematologists to address their concerns. For companies, we offer a welfare service and sustainability membership that engages employees in health prevention and blood donation. We organize awareness webinars, donation days, and monitor employee health, providing impact reports. These activities are included in the company's sustainability report and contribute to B-Corp certification. Our third pillar involves management software for hospitals. We offer a plugin that optimizes blood stock management in hospitals by managing donor portfolios and the relationships between donors, associations, and hospitals. By knowing the blood stock levels, we can send automatic recalls or alerts when blood is needed and there are donors nearby ready to donate. With the help of AI, we can predict future blood stock needs, required blood types, and the timing of potential shortages.

Product security as a result is costly, inefficient and difficult to scale at a time when secure software development becomes of national security significance. By end-to-end automating product security work like testing, prioritization, remediation and threat modelling, Nullify can enable product security teams to focus on higher-leverage security work.

Elythea is an ML/DL-driven platform that obstetricians in any setting use to predict risk for complications of pregnancy (postpartum hemorrhage, c-section, eclampsia) before they ever happen. We use information that is available at the point of care, so we can make the prediction as early as the 1st trimester, allowing doctors months to prepare in advance! We use clinical history/demographic information that is available at the point-of-care, so we can make the prediction as early as the 1st trimester, in developed or developing countries, allowing doctors months to prepare in advance! Knowing high-risk earlier allows for blood/medicine/tailored clinical guidance to be prepared, reducing mortality/costs >90%. Our models use proprietary models to surpass gold standard risk assessments in the current clinical space. Our preliminary clinical trials have demonstrated 3x greater sensitivity for high risk classification of hemorrhage when comapred to the current widely used hemorrhage assessment score.

AI content platform - Personalized generative AI for organizations. Typetone (former Schrijven.AI) helps brands and companies to implement generative AI organization wide to generate content and text. We help with AI text in the tone of voice and brand identity of your organization. Organizations today rely heavily on content for their daily operations. However, creating this content can be a costly affair, especially if it has to be done on a large scale. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) now offers a solution to reduce these costs and streamline the content creation process. Nonetheless, the output of AI tools can often be generic and not match the specific style and identity of your organization or brand. Especially at scale, the use of these tools can lead to a sameness of text, and organizations (and their users) no longer recognize the brand in the text. For example, Bol.com's marketing content is very different from Coolblue's, but with tooling like ChatGPT, that distinction doesn't show up well. This is where Typetone offers a solution. Typetone is a tool that personalizes AI output to your own or a brand's writing style. With Typetone, an organization can create content efficiently and affordably, without compromising on quality and brand identity. The result is content that is not only unique and authentic, but also reflects the tone and values of a brand.

At TwinAI, we aim to make AI accessible for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). While writing prompts became extremely popular in 2023, we believe that the full potential of AI is far from being utilized. Platforms like ChatGPT and Bard are mostly used on an individual level by people on the work floor, but we believe that the real added value lies in automating business processes using AI. Therefore, we offer an AI platform that makes it easy to use AI models to smarten and speed up business processes, without any programming experience. However, each company is different and based on specific requirements, we determine what best fits the customer's situation. With the help of the Twin platform, you can implement various models such as ChatGPT, Bard, Llama, and Mistral, or have them work together to achieve the best possible result. Because we make direct use of the APIs of these models, we can offer a high level of configuration, and we can apply the self-learning capabilities of AI to the specific data and characteristics of our clients, thereby offering much higher usability than if one would use the standard chat system of many contemporary AI models.

Nov 15, 2022
Mistikist is a unique neuroscience app that helps you change your brain waves, relax, focus, sleep, increase productivity and even program your subconscious mind! In just 8 minutes go from Beta to Alpha brain waves! Alpha brainwave is the sweet spot where magic happens. Alpha brain frequency is related with "Super Learning", "Enhanced Focus", and "Relaxation". Brainwaves and their effects: * Epsilon brain waves: (0,1 Hz - 0,5 Hz) Spiritual Awakening, Heart Brain Coherence * Delta brain waves: (0,5 Hz - 4 Hz) Deep Sleep, Dreaming, Healing, Regeneration * Theta brain waves: (4 Hz - 8 Hz) Meditation, Light Sleep, Hypnosis, Enhanced Creativity, Deep Relaxation * Alpha brain waves: (8 Hz - 12 Hz) Relaxation, Super Learning, Calm, Focus, Subconscious Mind Programming, Creativity, Reduced Stress * Low Beta brain waves: (12 Hz - 15 Hz) Light Relaxation, Attentive States, Alertness * Beta brain waves: (15 Hz - 22 Hz) Anxiety, Busy, External Stimulation, Active Thinking, High Alertness, Low attention lifespan, * High Beta brain waves: (22 Hz - 38 Hz) Highly Alert, Anxious, Stressed, Fight - Flight - Freeze Mechanism, High Anxiety, Overstimulation, Agitation * Gamma brain waves: (40 Hz - 100 Hz) Concentration, Deep Focus, Problem Solving, Memory Recall, Deep Meditation, Enhanced creativity, High Information Processing * Lambda brain waves: (100 Hz - 200 Hz) Spiritual Awakening, Heart Brain Coherence What are Binaural Beats? Human ear can not hear or detect sounds below 20 Hz and above 20.000 Hz. For example you want to change your brain waves to beautiful Alpha brain waves by using sounds. However Alpha brainwave is resonating in 8 - 12 Hz which is below your audible range. In order for you to resonate in this frequency, you need to use what is called "carrier frequency". If you listen to a sound formation, from left ear 100 Hz from right ear 108 Hz, there is 8 Hz difference between 108 - 100 = 8, and your brain will eventually start harmonizing with this frequency. This is called "Binaural Beats". There is a lot of research on this subject and its effects on the human brain, mind and psychology. For Binaural Beats to work, using earphones / headphones are required. What you can do with Mistikist ? * Create your own brainwave frequencies * Record your own voice as affirmation and listen them as mind messages * Create your own Mind Movies * Change your brain waves in seconds * Create your own sacred geometry patterns * Program your subconscious mind * Get rid of bad habits (Quit Smoking, quit drinking etc.) * Create your own Kaleidoscope * Become super productive * Sleep like babies * Unlock your full potential * Become calm * Relax * Super learn anything so fast * Deep Focus * Reduce anxiety * Remove fear (Social phobia, Arachnophobia, Acrophobia, Aerophobia, Agoraphobia, Astraphobia etc.) * Heal your childhood traumas * Heart Brain Coherence * Regulate Nervous System * Have Mystical Experience Mistikist mostly uses Earth's natural frequency which is called Schumann Resonance 7.83 Hz. This frequency is actually a sweet spot between Alpha and Theta brain waves. You are awake, you are calm, you are ready to learn anything. Mistikist can help you in these categories: * Mental Support * Subconscious Mind Programming * Anti Stress * Sleep * Frequency * Self Love * Self Worth * Memory Boost * Creativity Boost * Energy Boost * Deep Focus * Deep Study * Brain Coherence * Gratitude * Health * Success * Attraction * Relaxation You can even use Virtual Reality Glasses and greatly enhance your experience. Cardboard VR Headset and similar VR Glasses are supported by Mistikist. So why wait? Become the best version of yourself now! #mystic #mistik #mysticist #mysctical #mystik #mystical #mistika #mistica #mystica #mystikist #brainwaves #brain #mind

New drugs fail in human clinical trials 90% of the time. These failures can be traced directly back to the consistent inability of preclinical animal studies to predict clinical success, yet the design process for preclinical animal studies has remained largely unchanged for decades; scientists read a tiny fraction of published literature and write their experimental protocols in 2-4 weeks. This time-consuming, tedious process is not only a major pain point for in-vivo scientists but leads to substantial experimental design flaws, resulting in unreliable data with which billion-dollar decisions are made. At ModernVivo, we are revolutionizing this antiquated process by equipping scientists with tools that enable them to write in-vivo protocols more effectively. Our technology empowers scientists to streamline their work, accelerating drug development timelines.

We empower creators by giving them complete control of their creative work, and ensuring they can be paid fairly. Creativity is controlled chaos. Simply keeping track of the creative process is a full-time job. Getting compensated for creative work is a whole other challenge: - Incorrect metadata means musicians don’t get paid - AI companies are training their systems on creators’ work without compensation With Streamline, creators spend more time being creative and less time on repetitive, administrative tasks. Correct attribution, and control over the use of their work means that creators get paid fairly for what they do. We solve problems for the creative industries in a cloud-based workflow management system that: - Streamlines projects - Organises data - Frees up time for creativity - Captures 100% of rights metadata at the moment of creation - Rationalises compensation for AI training Streamline takes media files, creator details, and rights data and turns them into an interlinked web of connections. We automatically record 100% of attribution and ownership at the moment of creation. Creators create, machines do the boring work - everyone’s happy!

In response to these pain points, Yevul Info has thrived on an AI platform that's revolutionizing sustainable farming.

This approach requires no initial investment or maintenance, ensuring immediate profitability. Data is continuously being sent to our cloud-based system.

The CarePay is creating a new way to pay for care that is more affordable and accessible. With CarePay, you can get the care you need when you need it without having to worry about the cost. Our Care Now Pay Later model combines membership benefits and health insurance. We offer different payment options including monthly instalments and no-interest financing. The Care Now Pay Later model is a relatively new concept in the Asian market, so there are not many direct competitors yet. However, there are a number of companies that offer similar services, such as: Atome: Atome is a Singapore-based BNPL company that offers instalment plans for online and offline purchases. It is currently available in 7 countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Hoolah: Hoolah is an Australian BNPL company that offers instalment plans for online and offline purchases. It is currently available in Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand. Splitit: Splitit is an Israeli BNPL company that offers instalment plans for online and offline purchases. It is currently available in 40 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Sezzle: Sezzle is an American BNPL company that offers instalment plans for online purchases. It is currently available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Klarna: Klarna is a Swedish BNPL company that offers instalment plans for online and offline purchases. It is currently available in 17 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These companies all offer similar services to Care Now Pay Later, but they may have different features and fees. It is important to compare the different options available before choosing a BNPL provider. The Care Now Pay Later model is still a relatively new concept in the Asian market, so it is likely that more competitors will emerge in the future. This is because the BNPL market is growing rapidly in Asia, and there is a demand for more flexible payment options. We can capture a significant share of the $600M billion dollar care market in Asia. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2023 to 2030, reaching $914 billion by 2030. If you're looking for a more affordable and accessible way to pay for care, then CarePay is your solution. Visit our website https://carepay.mn/ or contact us to learn more.

See our future-dated mock press release for the best understanding of Upvote. Voter-turnout at all-time-high as politicians partner with Upvote to better understand their electorate on an issue-by-issue basis. Des Moines, IA – November 5, 2024 Voter turnout among those aged 18 - 35 has reached an all-time high this election cycle, thanks largely to widespread politician partnerships with Upvote. Upvote’s verified information has taken the guesswork out of politics, freeing representatives to act in the best interest of their constituents. Since their inception, Upvote has informed and empowered voters nationwide to instigate change within their political jurisdictions by providing a trusted connection between representatives and their constituents, culminating in a renewed sense of faith in American Institutions. “Before I started using Upvote, I had completely given up on politics,” Shared Nathan P. “I felt like most politicians had a hidden agenda - that they overlooked their constituents in favor of special interests. Now I want to participate because we’re seeing that change is possible.” Upvote transforms the way voters connect with their elected officials by providing a platform that groups, verifies, educates, and empowers them. Their curated, unbiased news feed keeps voters informed and up-to-date on their top policy interests and representatives. Politician ratings give a clear picture of how officials represent important issues. Issue tracking brings plain-language to complex policy and its impact on individuals and their communities. Representative profiles make it easy to understand motivations through campaign finance contributions by special interest, personal investments, voting history by issue, and unbiased bios. Most importantly, verification provides a direct line of communication between voters and their representatives, giving weight to the voice of verified constituents. “I never felt like I actually knew who these politicians were or how their actions matched their words.” shared John H. “I would try to research, but the information was so hard to find and to understand. Now I just check Upvote. Not only do I understand what’s going on, I can see how I’m influencing these outcomes in real-time. It’s addictive.” Beyond serving constituents, Upvote provides a critical service for politicians and their back-office staff. Through their constituent verification mechanism, Upvote has re-architected the public forum to cut through the inherent noise of traditional social media platforms. Officials now know that they’re communicating with real, verified voters in their jurisdiction. They are given a platform to explain their actions and beliefs directly to those that they represent. They are also equipped with granular, proprietary data regarding verified constituent sentiment across all key policy areas. This deep, informed connection allows them to better serve their constituents, and has allowed them to build a reputation through effective service instead of fundraising. “My top priority has always been to effectively serve my constituents, but there was no way for me to stay deeply connected with them at scale.” shared Congressman Brad T. “Aside from town halls and door knocking, it was difficult for me to gather the data-points I needed to serve them on every issue. Now, I check Upvote before every vote on the house floor. My constituents even help me draft language in the bills I bring to subcommittees. The best part is that I’ve gotten so much recognition for my service through Upvote that I don’t need to fundraise nearly as much. I can just focus on serving my community.” Through their platform, Upvote has proven that it is possible to disrupt traditional lobbying and campaign finance, placing democracy’s outcomes back in the hands of the voter.

The company / mission: Altheia is a health technology company specializing in unlocking data to truly put the patient first - in a way that prioritizes health equity and literacy in a scalable and affordable way. Introducing the Offering: The U.S. is a leader in technological advancements, but patient quality, outcomes and experience lag other countries, with the main reasons being data fragmentation, the amount of unstructured data in the system, and data ownership issues preventing data sharing. Complete patient health records has been the north star for many years, but technology and unclear economics have been blockers. Our offering is Acuvia, which leverages technological advancements to tackle this noble cause. First, we use AI enabled ingestion engines to read and store unstructured data, and combine it with structured for a complete patient view. Second, all data is patient consented – eliminating battles over data ownership and downstream uses of data. Our first focus area / use case for using the complete patient health record is Care Management. We layer on AI models and analytics to predict disease and prioritize outreach, while simultaneously engaging the patient in their own health and data uses. Because the collected data is patient owned, we are able to offer in-app incentives and shared data monetization plays (for example, in Life Sciences).

With the increasing democratization of generative AI tools, there is a huge concern about their potential impact on the environment. As more and more people gain access to them, the risk of excessive and unsustainable consumption increases. If we project this access into the future and its eventual transition to a three-dimensional domain, and subsequent on-demand manufacturing, all indications are that most objects will be synthetically generated in minutes by the end of this decade. This is the perfect scenario for increasing production to unprecedented levels, but what it could lead to, however, is a significant increase in waste and an unsustainable increase in demand for energy and raw materials. The question here is whether we will really want this as an advanced society. At Deep Design Systems we are researching and developing software based on different AI techniques with the mission to regulate, raise awareness and promote the responsible use of intelligent generative tools by redefining the industrial design process. We focus on optimizing the responsible production of objects, through applied AI research and the development of new creative protocols, with the ultimate goal of supporting a friendly transition towards a future in balance with the environment.

The idea that pipelines this project starts with AI technology. AI becomes larger and has had more significance by time goes on. According to my own research, the level of AI has evolved a lot and more and more products are ready to be introduced on the market. The most crucial point of the business is whether you can generate yield from the products and services. I am intending to sell “knowhow and consulting service” learned by the Machine. And I am pretty sure that many early-stage businesses and startups will come to us to listen to our consulting service. You may ask why “consulting”. I have been thinking of the most profitable business idea and I came to this. I think the margin after provision of the service will be the most among other businesses when you sell your knowledge. Here, Consulting, it includes a variety of services from business management to performance analysis. Basically, what I think is that you train the model and customize environments and variables applicable to the model forecasting and analyzing the performance of the business. Different variables will generate different outcomes and the mission of the company is to find the most appropriate variable in the specific scenario. I need to research more about the competitors about what technology they use, how can we outperform in the market as a beginner.

Our mission at BasEd is to revolutionize the way people learn by providing a cutting-edge educational platform that combines the power of microlearning, gamification, and artificial intelligence. With the rapid advancements in technology and the changing landscape of education, traditional learning methods are becoming outdated and ineffective. That's where BasEd comes in. We believe that learning should be engaging, personalized, and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or location. Our educational platform is designed to cater to the needs of modern learners who are constantly on the go and have limited time to dedicate to learning. By breaking down complex topics into bite-sized, easily digestible lessons, we make learning more manageable and enjoyable. Our microlearning approach ensures that learners can fit learning into their busy schedules, whether it's during their commute, lunch break, or before bed. But we don't stop at just delivering content. Our platform incorporates gamification elements to make learning a fun and interactive experience. Learners can earn points, badges, and rewards as they progress through their learning journey, providing them with a sense of achievement and motivation to continue learning. We believe that by gamifying the learning process, we can make it more engaging and increase knowledge retention. Artificial intelligence is at the core of our platform, enabling us to provide personalized learning experiences. Our AI algorithms analyze learners' performance, preferences, and goals to deliver tailored content and recommendations. This personalized approach ensures that learners receive the most relevant and effective learning materials, maximizing their learning outcomes. At BasEd, we understand the importance of collaboration and social learning. Our platform allows learners to connect with peers, mentors, and experts in their field, fostering a sense of community and enabling knowledge sharing.
