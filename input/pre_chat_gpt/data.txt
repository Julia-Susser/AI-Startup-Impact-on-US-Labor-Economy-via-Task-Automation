The Beautiful.AI team has spent decades working on presentations—writing them, designing them, and building software to make them. During that time, we’ve watched way too many people bang their heads against the wall trying to turn ideas into visual presentations. And so we decided to do something about it. We believe that the only way to guarantee good presentation design is to build the intelligence of a designer directly into the tool. Thus, Beautiful.AI suggests ways to visualize your ideas and makes it incredibly easy to customize the design. It knows what’s on your slide, what you might add later, and how to adjust the layout when you do. (And we’d like to think it has pretty good taste, too). We are constantly working to make Beautiful.AI better—adding more templates and design options, improving our recommendations, and making it even easier for you to do beautiful work. Whatever it takes to help you inspire more people, close more deals, win more pitches, and get more sleep.
