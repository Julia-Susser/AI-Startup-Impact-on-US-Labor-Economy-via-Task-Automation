Async Art is helping to create a new art revolution built on the Ethereum blockchain. Our users create, collect, and trade programmable art comprising a Master work and Layers that are independently owned and controlled: our users become part of the art themselves. Imagine pointing to a landscape painting and knowing that you own the sky or the stars. Meanwhile, an anonymous collector in Tokyo owns the lone figure in the background and an AI in London controls the snaking river running through the piece. All three of you alter the painting at any time within parameters designed by the artist. You might, depending on your artistic whim, change the sky from day to night while the Tokyo collector may lie dormant for years... throughout the entire time, the AI adjusts the saturation of the river’s water based on daily stock market volatility. Welcome to 21st century art.

AI Verse Logo
AI Verse
1-10
2020
AI Verse offers a self-service image factory that produces high-quality annotated synthetic datasets for the needs of computer vision engineers. An entirely novel process enables the user to describe their ideal dataset and launch its generation on AI Verse’s render farm, a scalable cloud-hosted cluster of GPU machines, each able to procedurally build a 3D scene and render photorealistic images in a few seconds. The dataset builder offers simple but powerful inputs for scene description, lighting and camera placement, emulating the work of a 3D artist in just a few clicks. The user specifies a desired type of environment (e.g. living room, bedroom, office) and chooses object classes of interest from a catalog of 1000+ assets in ongoing expansion. These inputs are enough to procedurally generate any desired number of 3D scenes, respecting user-defined constraints while offering the variations in appearance and content necessary to AI robustness on tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. The user can also specify activities to be performed by human agents in the scenes, ranging from simple postures to leisure or work-related activities (e.g. typing on a keyboard, watching TV). A wide range of lighting scenarios can be applied in order to simulate varying weather and time of the day. The placement of the camera is also randomized according to simple and effective constraints that can be defined according to the engineer’s use case. Sensor parameters (e.g lens parameters, depth-of-field, exposure) can also be adjusted. The process of setting and adjusting the scene and image parameters is made interactive and engaging through the use of live previews, allowing the user to visualize within a few seconds an image rendered on-the-fly on one of our GPU machines, corresponding to the input parameters. Availability of GPU machines for previews is guaranteed though a session-booking system. Once satisfied with their inputs, the user can launch the generation of any desired number of 3D scenes and images captured from those scenes, along with their choice of automatically generated labels (e.g. object 2D/3D boxes, instance masks, depth image). Parallelized rendering on the cloud enables delivery of thousands of images in just a couple hours. The dataset management UI enables the engineer to track progress on any of their dataset orders, and visualize a sample of images from a given dataset as soon as it is available. Once the dataset is completed, the user can download it from the cloud by generating an expiring link whenever needed, which enhances data privacy. The downloadable dataset is presented in a format that makes it ready for AI training and easy to combine with other datasets.

2020
Ni-CAT is working on AI-assisted research and development of next-generation battery materials, which is the key to the transition to battery electric vehicles. Ni-CAT believes that the speed of EV transition is still not enough to prevent global warming and replace carbon-based fuels in near future, and it is not related to money or resources. We believe that speeding up EV transition is possible with our novel methodology, which combines three approximation to the solution: our unique AI-assisted materials research, digitalized reactor farm and our novel surfactant-assisted synthesis. As the electrification of the automotive industry expands, we deliver state-of-the-art technologies to meet the industry’s high-quality standards. To help our customers to step up the EV transition, we will be working on our research and development of lower-cost/higher performance, ultra-high energy density battery materials to serve innovative solutions for a brighter future. With our expertise in the application of machine learning in material science, we are developing low cobalt/high nickel lithium cathode materials. Cathode determines the type of a lithium battery and is the limiting factor for nickel-based batteries. Further improvement in battery performance is possible through AI-assisted custom high nickel cathode materials with increased charge rate, charge to discharge ratio, tap density, or any other specifications. By our unique computer-controlled digital reactor farm, we numerize synthesis parameters and output specifications for the machine learning algorithm we have been developing.

FANTM’s first product, the DEVLPR, is an open-source hardware and software elecromyography platform built for the Arduino community. Large companies like Facebook and Apple own most of the product IP around the nascent EMG-based human-computer interaction space, but we believe deeply that innovation is only possible when everyone has access. The DEVLPR thus allows hobbyists and researchers to explore the nascent EMG-based human-computer interaction space at a price point that anyone can afford. It was co-founded in 2020 by Finn Kuusisto and Ezra Boley in Madison, Wisconsin.

Participants record their messages into Petals, any time of day from anywhere in the world. Access the Petals through the smart navigation of the Flower, jump into the conversation at any point—a keyword or significant phrase—and contribute your Petal to the Seed, expanding the conversation. As the Flower grows into a multilevel bloom, the AI-driven, fractal-style discussion allows many people to talk about a complex topic from a multitude of perspectives. View the final recorded Flower at any time—in its entirety or by choosing significant Petals identified and grouped by topic or keyword.

Explority is the world's first transformational ABM platform — designed to help revenue teams generate and close more pipeline faster by transforming low-interest accounts into high-intent customers. B2B has fundamentally changed. Traditional marketing tactics like paid ads and SEO are becoming more expensive and less effective than 5-10 years ago, while a growing tidal wave of content floods the market thanks to ChatGPT — forcing brands to seek new and more authentic ways to cut through the noise. As a result, forward-thinking marketers are pivoting to modern demand creation tactics to reach prospects across the buyer journey — creating in-person and online marketing experiences, providing more personalized content, and building communities. The problem? It's tough to figure out which interactions best increase revenue, as the number of touchpoints grows and becomes more complex at scale. Personalizing and delivering the highest-value interaction at the right time for each individual across the buyer committee in each account and things become borderline impossible. Explority solves this with AI.

Listing Bird offers a “one-click” wholesale purchasing solution for all eCommerce / brick & mortar merchants. Global sourcing hasn’t changed much since Alibaba launched in 1999 – it requires any retail merchant to undergo complex factory selection, quality control, negotiations, and importing processes.

bridge_ci provides private equity, public affairs, and corporate teams with a unique combination of world-class machine intelligence, data, and political and strategy expertise. Always bleeding edge bridge_ci always integrates the fastest and best AI, computation, OSINT, digital collaboration tools, and alternative data into our workflow to ensure our operational efficiency and outputs are second to none. Speed + Creativity It would take a traditional firm years/decades to find insights that can be done in hours or days with our technology ecosystem. The time saved frees our minds to create more thoughtful strategies – not ones that are rehashed & commoditized. Avoid triple the labor costs, risk, and complexity. Organizations wanting to leverage similar techniques would need to pay for a strategic consulting firm, an alternative data provider, and a team of data scientists to transform, make, and model the data. Unfortunately, only a handful of people in the globe have this combination of expertise, so there are zero guarantees of success. The translation layer between data, strategic, and technical teams is prone to errors and communication breakdowns - increasing project time, complexity, and costs. We are experts in integrating all aspects of the former and have proven it at the largest organizations in the world (literally) over the last fifteen years.

Boost

2020
Boost provides home co-investments to help young adults with the deposit they need to buy their first home. Most first time buyers get a mortgage for 80% of the purchase price, meaning they need a 20% deposit. We double the amount they already have, so if they've saved up 10% we give them another 10%. After they buy, they pay their mortgage each month, but they don't pay us a thing until they sell their home. When they sell, the amount they pay to us depends on whether the value of their home has risen or fallen since they purchased it. Boost recently received investment from Santander and is currently participating in the 'Launch Lab' accelerator programme in London.

Fermata provides computer vision solutions for Crop Producers. Combining industry-leading artificial intelligence with off-the-shelf digital camera technology, Fermata has created a robust, yet affordable platform designed to detect pests and disease significantly earlier than human scouts. Our computer vision solution ensures that the farmer is alerted to issues in his production area before they get out of hand, enabling him to spend time fixing problems instead of wasting time finding them. As early detection is key when dealing with an infectious disease or pest infestation, Fermata scans the crop 24/7, analyzing each plant to ensure they are healthy and pathogen-free. Use of Fermata technology reduces crop losses and significantly decreases the need for pesticide, chemical, and beneficial insect usage – saving the grower substantially on crop inputs, and increasing harvests.

JOGO is the future of football. This revolutionary player development platform provides productive insights of players to predict the future faces of football. Via an easy to use app linked to insole sensors, JOGO helps the football stars of tomorrow get noticed and supported. Trainers, scouts, and agents can optimize training, find that hidden gem, and create new opportunities for their players with our platform. Imagine getting actionable insights on a player’s specific needs, based on 200 data points. Insights on acceleration, top speed, number of ball touches, leg distribution, shot speed, and much more. Not just plain data, but suggested actions that can help to improve on these improvement points. Always. Player. Specific. Even though football is the number one sport in the world, it falls behind when it comes to the usage of factual, objective data. In a tech-savvy world most training, coaching and scouting are still done purely based on plain, subjective data. Especially in youth football. Even in the best football academies, talented youth players are still developed in a conservative context. However, data technology gets slowly more accepted. Just as the insight that youth development is key to a club’s success becomes more and more visible. With 3.000 pro and 600.000 amateur clubs, containing a total of 200.000.000 youth players, football needs an upgrade. JOGO allows the football community to do just that: use data to get better. Our platform uses groundbreaking data technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine vision (MV), in-shoe sensor tech, and cognitive tests, to provide a 360-degree view of a player’s potential. Every. Single. Second.

HarvestAi provides a SaaS platform for growth prediction and operational optimization of high-tech greenhouses through the use of Big Data and Machine Learning. Our goal is to put technology at the service of greenhouse efficiency to help them reach their peak of productivity and sustainability. Indoor farms are collecting vast amounts of data on relevant growth parameters, but this data has not been fully utilized. We take advantage of this data and pay particular attention to predicting transplanting and harvest dates and what adjustments need to be made to achieve the highest possible crop yield. Thus, no need to be a fortune teller to manage agriculture exploitations, since Harvest AI’s software can tell you exactly how much to harvest, when to harvest it, and how to maximize resource efficiency. Value-added to our customers: - Increased production yield by increasing the number of harvest cycles. - Reduce labor costs. - Minimization of waste and product losses.

Usually, it takes 4-8 hours every sprint for developers to convert a design into code. Often this work is tedious and repetitive, and much more importantly, prone to bugs and issues. A lot of back-and-forth happens between designers and developers during this process. This back-and-forth slows product momentum and can cause massive company losses. It happened to us at our previous company Orai and it happens every day to teams across the globe; big and small. So we built CopyCat to help teams build UI up to 80% faster using AI-powered code generation. Now you can take a design in Figma and get code from it in 30 seconds and then work on the important and rewarding bits faster.

Syntho is a data technology organization with a strong expertise in privacy enhancing technologies (PET), headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was founded in 2020 with the goal of solving the privacy dilemma and enable the open data economy, where data can be used and shared freely and privacy guaranteed. Syntho offers privacy-preserving synthetic data to unlock your data and take away legitimate privacy concerns. We develop AI-based software that can be trained on any form of data. After training, our Syntho Engine is able to generate new, ‘synthetic’ data. This is the essence of what we do - we generate a completely new, artificial dataset that reproduces the statistical characteristics of the original dataset, while warranting that no records from the original dataset are present. In other words, the synthetic dataset has no privacy risk, while maximizing data utility. This allows you to easily use and share all of your data without privacy concerns and boost innovation.

QueryPal Logo
QueryPal

2020
The world has moved from docs to chat. Askers bypass stale docs to ask experts directly, who then give up on maintaining the docs, leading future askers to bypass stale docs, and so on. McKinsey estimates that 20% of information workers' time is spent on finding information or answering questions in chat. Experts are overwhelmed and askers are frustrated. QueryPal answers questions right where they are asked -- in Slack and Microsoft Teams -- using past chats, wikis, shared drives, and more. This means askers get faster/deeper answers more quickly, and experts never need to answer the same question twice. If you answer it anywhere, we'll answer it everywhere.

Yorba Logo
Yorba
11-50
2020
The internet is a mess. Our digital economy runs on data – to get it, almost every app, site, and service makes you create an account. The average person has over 150 online accounts. Some of them you use every day. Some of them you forgot about years ago. But they all have one thing in common: your data. It’s everywhere. It’s impossible to keep track of who has your personal info or what they’re doing with it, because Nobody reads privacy policies. Our security is compromised, our inboxes are full of marketing nonsense, and we’re paying for stuff we don’t use. That’s why we made Yorba. It’s like CRM in reverse. We aggregate all your online accounts and provide insights into your digital footprint, from privacy grades to fees to email rates. You can even delete accounts and unsubscribe from mailing lists, right from the app. Instead of exploiting our users’ trust, we simply charge a reasonable fee for a useful service. No catch. And we have much bigger plans. Web3 is a chance to reset how the internet runs. People shouldn’t have to choose between convenience, security, and privacy – businesses shouldn’t have to choose between ethics and earnings. Yorba can help.

Jan 1, 2020
Winners of "Best AI Product - Education" at 2022 CogX Awards: https://www.cogx.live/awards-winners E-Numeracy, makers of one of the UK’s most innovative online education products, has been recognised for excellence by Cognition-X, the “Davos of AI” and organisers of the CogX Festival. The UK company was awarded Best AI Product in Education 2022 yesterday evening in London at the CogX Awards, which recognise products and people who bring AI to life and revolutionise our approach to real world problems. E-Numeracy has created a unique way to provide a ”Second Chance” to rebuild the confidence and realise the potential of those whose low confidence with numbers has impacted their life chances or career. It is designed for learners of all ages: 16-19 year olds, apprentices, employees and adult/lifelong learners. This 4-minute video explains: https://youtu.be/ANmmvVy43Gk. While many EdTech products focus on schools, curricula and students, E-Numeracy’s focus is on “numeracy for employability” and the practical use of numbers - for work and for life. This is of interest not only to employers as they struggle to recruit, upskill their workforce and get apprentices work-ready, but also to colleges, who struggle to provide the maths tutoring needed by their vocational students to get them through their exams. In addition, E-Numeracy’s scalability and affordability mean it has an important contribution to make in social inclusion, regional regeneration and national upskilling – a key focus for government, for charities and for business CSR programmes (such as the £560m, 500,000 user Multiply adult numeracy programme). We are trialling the product with leading educationalists and Princes Trust learners, and will launch in the coming months. Our Advisors and supporters include leading educationalists, AI experts and academics from UCL’s Institute of Education, Cambridge University, etc.

Bilr is a legal billing software created for the modern lawyer and law firm, providing an easy means of timekeeping and billing. Record time on the go with your voice, whether you’re in a car, headed out of the courtroom, or elsewhere. Activate multiple concurrent billing timers to accurately track your time, ensuring that every billable hour is captured and invoiced. Remove the stress of manual bill review with our machine learning component, analyzing your invoices against your clients’ SLAs or billing guidelines, flagging errors for adjustment.

Safe Health Systems, Inc. (“SAFE Health”) is a Digital Healthcare company operated in partnership with Mayo Clinic (“Mayo”). The Company’s mission is to reduce the cost of routine care at population scale, and capture a share of the $2 trillion of global healthcare spend inevitably transitioning to digital delivery in this decade. Through this strategic partnership with SAFE, Mayo Clinic is committed to applying its accumulated knowledge, world-class clinical expertise, and general standard of excellence to empowering billions of patients worldwide with access to quality routine care. Core to realizing its mission is the Company’s Digital Health and Connected Diagnostics Platform that enables rapid implementation of specialized digital healthcare applications designed to improve access to affordable treatment of common medical conditions, efficient chronic disease management, and auditable remote patient monitoring (the “Platform”). Designed by the former Chief Architect of the CDC, the Platform combines virtualized provider services, AI-enabled care automation, electronic patient record interoperability, public health reporting, and remote point-of-care diagnostics to enable companies and world governments to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce delivery costs at population scale. Building on exclusive technology licenses from Columbia University, the Company has developed an integrated Connected Diagnostics System (“CDS”), which completes the connected care loop by enabling self-collection and real-time digital assessment of rapid diagnostic tests outside of the point of care, coupled with a proprietary system for enabling crowdsourced telehealth provider services at the speed and scale required for population-scale adoption. The CDS dramatically extends current telehealth capabilities and will enable a wide range of new remote patient care/monitoring applications.SAFE is currently implementing an IRB study in collaboration with Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University (“ASU”) designed with guidance from the FDA to secure EUA clearance for home (outside lab) use of multiple LFIA-platform COVID-19 rapid antigen and antibody tests.

For 99% of these folks, there is mismatch of when funds arrive into their accounts and when they need it for everyday expenses. They often don’t have a credit card and definitely don’t have excess income to bridge the gap. In addition to this, life critical services cost an unreachable $1400 or more per month. Beem uses AI to bridge this mismatch and reduce cost for these services by 90%. Beem works for everyone, including immigrants, undocumented folks, gig workers, tip based wage earners, seasonal earners and more. In the grand scheme of things, Beem is folding a large segment of informal economy into the formal economy by eliminating barriers and in turn delivering economic agains for the nation and people working in it. Beem plans to do this around the world, we are currently doing it in the US, we will be doing it in India next where $6T is stuck in the informal economy.

Peggy Logo
Peggy

Apr 18, 2020
Peggy is the secure marketplace for investment-grade art. In times of societal crisis and turmoil throughout humanity, artists pave the way for social change and transformation. As an investment, art is among the only appreciating asset classes you can also enjoy (like real estate), plus is uncorrelated to traditional markets. This is why billionaires and banks seek out art as a safe haven to preserve wealth in their portfolios. Yet tragically, the rest of us are unable to participate in the art market, and support the practice of emerging artists who create transformative messages through their works. Peggy partners with galleries and artists, to make living with and investing in art accessible to all. Finally you can buy incredible art at a price you can afford, and can later sell to fellow collectors if your tastes change or you seek to rebalance your art investments. Core to our values, Peggy does good by the artists themselves, who can finally earn artist royalties for all future secondary sales as well - something they miss out on today. Peggy also has powerful benefits for galleries (get in touch!) This is all made possible using sophisticated and proprietary AI and ML which keeps buyers and sellers protected without the need for the antiquated and opaque Auction House model.

This shift unlocks a disruptive opportunity to rethink our "presence" in a digital medium. In a world where 92% of people admitted multitasking during a meeting ([source](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-much-time-do-we-spend-in-meetings-hint-its-scary)), Beulr lets users be in two places at once.

Novai is a British biotechnology start-up, commercialising DARC Technology, an exploratory retinal biomarker for use in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) & glaucoma clinical studies. DARC combines an innovative patented biologic with a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and uses standard imaging equipment to identify cellular level disease activity. DARC Technology can be used to measure the impact of current and future therapeutics and interventions by assessment of disease activity whilst identifying non-responders to existing and new interventions, resulting in the avoidance of costly, ineffective or un-required medical management. DARC helps to stratify patients in clinical trials, resulting in the creation of enriched patient cohorts, consisting of those at highest risk of rapid disease progression. DARC has been developed by Professor M Francesca Cordeiro at University College London through Wellcome Trust funding and is now approved as an exploratory biomarker by the FDA & MHRA. Following further analysis of Phase II data, several other indications may follow, including Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Diabetes Mellitus and Cancer.

Apr 13, 2020
SEED-STAGE • LOGISTICS TECH • FOR-PROFIT • SOCIAL PURPOSE CORPORATION. For buyers and sellers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste, cost, and risk. WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech, and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target, and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food, medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills. Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020. PROBLEM Supply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper, faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges, including AI, IoT, 5G, printed electronics, and machine vision. SOLUTIONS We bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost, waste, and risk in perishable supply chains. -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity, and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's "got the ball." When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value. -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data, allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers, minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED, the top food waste non-profit, to bring this technology to market. -- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our "credit score for transparency." ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers, the higher the ProofScore. ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers, answering the question, where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development. -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials. BENEFITS Our products reduce customers' supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital, including keeping food and perishables out of landfills. Using our system, all supply chain partners know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes while improving collaboration and trust. And customer relationships are maximized by the delivery of fresh, safe products at full margin. CUSTOMER PROFILE Transparent Path technologies support food, pharmaceuticals, blood/plasma, transplant organs, and construction chemical shipments. The company also currently provides asset tracking for high-end hard goods. PARTNERSHIPS Transparent Path has created partnerships with Intel, T-Mobile, Duke University, and ReFED. Intel has donated hardware, software, and ongoing counsel since 2020. We are working with Second Sun Laboratories to develop the most advanced hardware in the market, and with a large multinational Japanese tech manufacturer to develop ProofScore. ACCELERATORS/INCUBATORS Over its short tenure, Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators, including 5G Open Innovation Lab, Microsoft for Startups, NewChip, and most recently, Plug and Play IoT. FUNDRAISING To date, Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping, two RegCF raises, three grants, and four angel investors. In April 2023, the company was awarded grants totaling $440,000 from the National Science Foundation, ReFED, and the State of Washington. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion. FOR MORE INFORMATION Headquartered in the US, Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver, a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist. Prior to founding the company, Weaver launched the Xerox Customer Experience Practice, where he managed a $550M services book of business. His executive team includes senior leaders from Amazon, General Mills, Microsoft, Target, KraftHeinz, Xerox PARC, and the University of California at Berkeley.

Global cybercrime damages are predicted to hit $10.5 Trillion dollars by 2025. That’s huge and in terms of GDP would be the third largest country by itself. With digital transformations on the rise, organizations are heavily reliant on third parties increasingly exposing them to cybersecurity and privacy risk, thereby eroding trust with customers. Our easy-to-use SaaS solution provides an integrated cyber risk intelligence, assessment, monitoring and regulatory compliance platform that helps organizations reduce their cybersecurity, privacy and third-party risk thereby building trust with customers. Current solutions grossly fall short as they don’t engage customers and third parties when it comes to risk management. Remember – it takes a village to fight cybercrimes. Our solution smartly engages the organization, their customers and third parties. Our unique platform architecture, supports multiple use cases and we have gained traction in all. - Cyber Insurance Risk - helping cyber insurance providers (insurers and brokers) better assess the risk of their clients - Third Party Risk Management - helping enterprises mitigate third party vendor / supplier risks - Info Security Certifications - SOC 2 or ISO 27001 or NIST - Regulatory Compliance We are revenue generating and our revenue comes from Annual SaaS subscription plans. Our Go To Market focuses on going after regulated industries first in North America and expand into India.

TieSet Logo
TieSet

Apr 2, 2020
TieSet Inc. is taking the initiative in collective intelligence era as we believe it is wisdom that drives the future technologies not data itself. We lead the field of intelligence-centric platform with a distributed learning paradigm shift such as federated learning and create an intelligence-centric platform led by world-class research scientists and engineers. Today, cloud-based AI and big data systems face significant challenges but aren’t equipped to meet them head-on. Data privacy has emerged as a global concern, but AI systems utilizing big data simply can’t preserve privacy while learning. Similarly, in a world where IoT and device data outpace the speed of bandwidth growth, latency in AI data processing is causing avoidable bottlenecks. TieSet has developed STADLE, a Scalable Traceable Adaptive Distributed Learning platform with a core feature of decentralized federated learning that preserves privacy while collecting and maximizing intelligence to be shared. Because intelligence is created and trained locally on edge devices to be gathered by STADLE, our platform generates high-quality intelligence without uploading data, enabling AI systems to operate and perform at scale while offline. Our message is simple. Collect, maximize and share the intelligence around the world. That is the world TieSet envisions for the next generation of technologies, for which we call the Internet of Intelligence (IoI) where intelligence is the one that is mainly exchanged over the Internet, not just raw private data. That said, AI is now transitioning from the product of big data to collective and continuous Intelligence, and can finally be productized in a variety of areas of our lives including finance, robotics, healthcare, automotive, education, public infrastructure, transportation, smart cities and energies, among a lot more others.

Today, event marketers are forced to use a system that's broken. To promote a simple webinar, they must create 60-80 pieces of content (emails, social posts, etc.) to comply with best practices. That means selecting images, writing copy, production and optimization, scheduling, and more. There's simply not enough time, and one result is that the event is not as successful as it could have been. Contentware is changing the way events are promoted. We've automated event promotion. Using AI and a 2-3 sentence description of your event, Contentware creates an entire marketing campaign of emails and social media posts - in a matter of minutes. These promotions are assigned to a strategic distribution calendar that's optimized to drive registration, and distributed via integrations with email and social media platforms. The campaigns that are produced by Contentware are agency-quality and built on digital marketing best practices. Contentware was developed by the same team that created Real Magnet, a marketing automation company that was acquired by Higher Logic in 2017.

Troove Logo
Troove
1-10
Feb 2020
Despite being the multi-billion dollar gateway to a trillion dollar industry, have you ever heard someone say, "College admissions is a really great process"? Neither have we and the failures of this antiquated, largely analog system drive cost and pain to both schools and students alike. With unprecedented pressure on schools today from declining population, rising costs, and increased competition from online alternatives, not to mention Covid, the time has come to disrupt and improve this system with technology. That's Troove. Troove shifts the admissions focus from enrollment to graduation, using AI to model the social and academic success markers of every school by engaging the people who have already found the success coveted by every incoming freshman -- the alumni. Alumni hold the success code for their schools and Troove has created the platform and process to quickly and cost effectively define that code so schools can better assess lasting academic and social fit, admitting the students most likely to graduate, not just enroll. And by concurrently building a large, diverse, global market of applicants, Troove can then filter that entire pool against the unique success code of every school, finding compelling matches for students and schools alike that were never previously possible. Troove's applicant pool is far larger than any one school can achieve on its own, increasing access and diversity, and breaking down the geographic barriers experienced by the 97% of schools that fall outside the top tier. This fundamentally shifts the admissions process from generating as many applications as possible to engaging with highly qualified candidates who understand their fit. This drives cost and process efficiencies across the school value chain as more students come, learn, graduate, and remain engaged for a lifetime with their schools. Better inputs lead to better outputs and by connecting the two largest communities within every school -- the alumni and the applicants -- Troove radically improves outcomes and value for students and schools alike.

Vent Creativity's Minerva surgical planning platform allows medical device manufacturers and surgeons to review 3D models of the anatomy of interest and actionable data from medical images. The cloud-based system can be accessed from any device and one-click upload of the files are returned in 15 minutes with surgical plans, compared to upwards of 7 hours of processing with current systems that all cost the healthcare system time and money. Additionally, VENT’s patented technology allows density mapping and interaction for informed surgical planning to allow users to know where the dense bone is, and where it can shift to with surgical intervention, which is critical to surgical outcomes. The additional benefit of the point clouds approach is that VENT reduces the burden of expensive and complicated segmentation software for most of the customers who want to plan surgery without the complex pre-planning procedures to worry about. Additionally, the system tracks validated patient reported outcomes and plan the most successful surgery available to the surgeon.

We’re promoting a blockchain-powered tool that helps to protect intellectual property — namely, all kinds of public content, — and monitor copyright violations. How it works Blockchain saves the timestamp and the IPFS saves the content, making the data immutable. On saving, the system delivers a digital certificate that becomes the piece of digital evidence of authorship. If somebody tries to save another writer's content, our AI won't allow them to do it: before saving, it would check the internet for reverse content. When saved, if the protected content gets published with no copyright, there'll be an alert. Also, we resolve blockchain-backed copyright issues.

AIPARK's SaaS solution AiVATAR creates digital human videos that speak multiple languages by simply inputting text. AiVATAR is a service that combines the following three technologies: - Text-To-Speech: AIPARK's proprietary artificial intelligence voice synthesis algorithm learns from datasets composed of text and audio and allows users to output speech by only entering text, based on the trained AI voice synthesis algorithm. AIPARK has developed its own algorithms and possesses multiple TTS solutions. The AI voices implemented using this technology are being utilized in JTBC morning broadcasts, industrial broadcasts, and audiobook companies. - Talking Head Generation: AIPARK's proprietary artificial intelligence video synthesis algorithm learns from tens of thousands of audio and facial data to output speaking videos regardless of the input voice. It has been trained on a large amount of data to naturally speak over 20 languages, including Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese. - Face Generation: This technology synthesizes and combines different faces to create completely new faces, generating virtual characters. It uses actual human faces rather than graphics for synthesis and re-creation, resulting in less visual discrepancy and freedom from portrait rights issues. With the multilingual digital humans created by AiVATAR, users can experience unlimited applications such as news production, product promotion, and educational broadcasts.

99bros is a digital insurance brokerage platform that allows customers to choose the most suitable solutions for their risk profile thanks to an integrated system made of artificial intelligence, multimedia content, and specialized consultants. Users can deepen the topics of interest through thematic guides created by the 99bros experts and obtain support from a customer service available 24/7. On top of that, by answering some quick questions on the website, the 99bros machine learning algorithm suggests the most suitable insurance coverage, which can be purchased online by the customers in a few seconds. In particular, 99bros solves the pension problem of the younger generations: the labor market is increasingly precarious, the average age increases and the withdrawal of the State from some areas of social support is inevitable; traditional insurance networks do not favor pension products as they are not very profitable, while 99bros takes advantage of digital channels and the young people’s attitude to investigate independently and buy online, to solve the problem allowing customers to subscribe to a pension fund in a breeze. The portal also provides both life and non-life products from the best insurance companies dedicated to individuals, families, and startups.

Apr 13, 2020
MedlyticsAi is standardizing data for all healthcare systems to enable interoperability & precision health. We believe patients should be at the center of healthcare and support the industry’s transition to a value-based-care system. We're helping to bridge the gap between disparate health systems & their inability to streamline systematic communication of health data; to achieve better patient outcomes and increase human longevity. How do we do this? Our solution’s ability to query patient information, significantly faster and much more accurate than any front-end API, will help physicians reduce the time spent looking at a computer screen. We do the hard work on the back-end, so physicians can do the critical work on the front-end; providing a high efficacy driven & personalized care approach. How do we do this? MedlyticsAi’s population health management platform leverages natural language processing , natural language understanding, machine learning, and other technological innovations; improving hospital workflow & enabling each physician to see, on average, 3 more patients per day/11.4hr work shift. We do this by significantly reducing the time spent on EHR chart review, which also helps to reduce physician burnout. The ability to transform existing health care data into the new standard (FHIR), will spark innovation and yield better patient outcomes. Our technology is strategically built to implement and comply with the standards set forth by Health level 7, FHIR v4.0.1, and the US Core Implementation Guide v3.1.0. We understand FHIR guidelines will continue to improve as we collectively journey on this endeavor. Thus, we are fully committed to monitoring, understanding, and quickly implementing improved updates to adhere to these evolving guidelines. Results are achieved through action. We analogize compliment pairings like theory and practical application, to depict interoperability and MedlyticsAi.

EthicsGrade Logo
EthicsGrade

Feb 1, 2020
EthicsGrade is a generative-AI powered ESG survey response solution for Chief Sustainability Officers in large enterprise and mid-market companies. As ESG has recently become quickly ubiquitous, a massive burden has arisen for Chief Sustainability Officers (CSOs). Ongoing requests for larger numbers of answers to ESG related questions have skyrocketed to the point where this can take as much as 50% of the CSO’s time. Responding to these surveys is a menial task, with massive risk yet significant ROI. If they ignore these requests, their company could struggle to raise capital efficiently, and even lose customers. This presents an ideal opportunity for an AI solution paired with our domain knowledge in sustainability reporting, and technical expertise. EthicsGrade allows CSOs to confidently delegate this task to be done by a junior employee in a fraction of the time it required previously, providing highly accurate answers together with references to non-public data sources based on EthicsGrade’s proprietary data set and knowledge graph.

Every year, millions of people have a stroke attack— an acute neurologic injury of the brain. Stroke patients could only be salvaged by an early treatment, which requires early diagnosis with brain CT or MRI. Hospitals around the globe have lots of MRI and CT scanners and can swiftly scan patients with stroke symptoms. Still, heavy workload and radiologists' shortage leads to the incorrect and delayed interpretation of the scans, resulting in the death or disability of millions. Therefore, hospitals need an automated system capable of scanning "every emergency brain CT or MRI" and alerting physicians regarding the stroke. hStroke is a computer-aided medical software using state-of-the-art deep learning models that detects acute stroke cases on brain MRI or CT within a minute and warns physicians. Thereby, physicians can start the correct treatment early and prevent patients from permanent disability and death. Hevi AI's first product, hStroke is deep learning-based medical software that scans every emergency brain MRI and CT scan and alerts doctors via smartphones for brain clots or bleeding. hStroke is an affordable, performant, user-friendly, and plug-in-play solution that can adapt and operate in various hospitals and scanners.

Born from the market-leading technology trusted by a leading global healthcare giant for over 18 years, MediFind also provides services for the pharma and healthcare ecosystem along with a product suite serving patients and caregivers. We're starting with 5 key areas: 1. Expert Finder. MediFind is the first platform in the world to collect and integrate doctor and health information from dozens of medical datasets, allowing us to identify global experts who are at the forefront of research and innovation for their respective field. Our network includes more than 2.5 million global physicians, and our physician index is constantly growing to ensure up-to-date results 2. Second Opinions. Our technology is built on algorithms that identify doctors with characteristics similar to your own, but with different enough viewpoints to provide alternative options for your care 3. Latest Advances Stay informed on the latest clinical research, culled and simplified from over 100,000 new pieces of global medical information reviewed every month. We use a combination of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, proprietary natural language processing algorithms, and our team of medical experts to extract the most important information and simplify the terminology so it's easier to act 4. Clinical Trials Find all active clinical trials for a given health condition, with current links to in-depth information 5.

LensAI is an AI-powered contextual computer vision ad solution that monetizes any visual content and fine-tunes targeting through identifying objects, logos, actions, and context and matching them with relevant ads. The core of LensAI Technology is associative thinking AI algorithm that, when applied to the digital advertising industry, automatically selects and embeds relevant ads into any content consumed by users in real-time. LensAI prioritizes first-party relationships and targets audiences based on the content they are interested in and drawn to, not personal information about users. LensAI does not depend on cookies or alternative user-level identifiers while enabling Advertisers to reach relevant audiences by tailoring ads to the context. As users have become very particular about the kind of ads they want to see, LensAI focuses on providing value with every ad. To make it more fun, LensAI's in-image and in-video ads look like shopping hints that users may have seen in video games rather than traditional ads. The analytics engine of the LensAI technology measures how every ad performs contextually and how different contexts perform against each other and in general. LensAI takes digital advertising to a new level with value, relevance and no privacy hackles.

Assetux Logo
Assetux

Feb 19, 2020
Assetux.com is a redefined fiat on-ramp for EVM-compatible blockchains. It allows users to purchase any tokens that are deployed on EVM blockchains using their credit or debit cards. While most Web3 projects rely on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to trade tokens, these DEXs have high entry barriers. They require users to use the native currency of the blockchain to pay gas fees when swapping tokens, and there may be no other options available for buying specific tokens. Assetux is designed to provide an alternative to DEXs. By using Assetux, Web3 projects such as DeFi, Play-to-Earn, GameFi, AI, Metaverses, and others can give users the option to purchase their tokens with Visa or MasterCard, without needing to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements for purchases up to $1000. This makes it easier for users from the Web2.0 community to make the transition to Web3, using a method that is familiar to them. Assetux is not intended to compete with DEXs, but rather it provides a complementary service. Assetux leverages DEX liquidity pools as a source of liquidity, which means that all trades made through Assetux are executed via DEXs. This model is advantageous for those who are already active in the crypto space and are providing liquidity to DEXs. Assetux's use of DEX liquidity pools sets it apart from other fiat on-ramps. This approach enables fiat trading for any token that has liquidity on one of the DEXs, making it a more versatile and comprehensive solution.

OptiStructure

Feb 15, 2020
OptiStructure is an AI solution that works in a general way that initially the architects design on software. OptiStructure is an AI solution for the Construction Industry. The way this works in a general way is that initially the architects design on software like Autocad the look and feel. Then the engineers take on the design to execute. A crucial part is the structural design. Structural design is the methodical investigation of the stability, strength, and rigidity of structures. The basic objective in structural analysis and design is to produce a structure capable of resisting all applied loads without failure during its intended life. Structural Engineers typically use various software solutions (same as the architects use Autocad for example) such as ETABS, SAP2000, etc. After the structural engineers finish their design, OptiStructure connects to their software, takes the output, and optimizes it against any variable. Most frequently the optimization is done against cost. So far the minimum optimization that has taken place is 10% from our solution and the maximum is 37%. Imagine a building of a skyscraper for example worth 100s million saving even 10% is a huge number. Currently, OptiStructure is growing organically with a presence in London, Dubai, Athens, San Francisco, Boston, and Singapore.

Jan 9, 2020
Minte.ai is a B2B medtech/insurtech company. Our solution transforms the unstructured medical documentation "jargon" into valuable, structured information, which can be automatically processed by algorithms, and understood by humans. We qualify as an insurtech, as our current focus is automation of medical (insurance) claims processing. After 2 successful Proof of Concept projects in Poland, we have signed the first 5yr contract with major insurer in Poland, which is being actively implemented. The value proposition for Minte clients and the business case is clear - for an average insurance product (500.000 claims/year), an insurance company can save approximately 19.000 man-days. In addition, the insurer gets transparent and fast claims processing (which lowers customer churn), and data that can be used for fraud detection and product improvement. From a longer term perspective Minte is a medtech, and the solution may be applied in many other verticals, wherever mass medical documentation processing is essential. Those areas will be explored as soon as the insurtech line is established. The Minte Medical Model Minte is deep tech, expert-based and extended with ML/AI, which gives them an unfair advantage over generic NLP/AI/ML software. The IP is 100% owned by Minte.ai.

PipFeed is an A.I. powered reading app for prolific readers. The app for people who have a desire to learn. People who want more than just "breaking news" apps. People who love ideas. People who want to grow. People who lead. People who create. People who inspire. Pipfeed’s Artificial Intelligence system observes which articles you have interacted with and learns your likes and dislikes. Our newsstand app includes the best online blogs, latest articles, and the latest news articles from trusted sources and showcases them to you in a neat way. It's like having a personal Editor who publishes a newspaper just for you. There is a big disconnect with the way articles are read over the internet as most apps only focus on the latest news from top websites with the only source of traffic for most of these blogs being google. AI is the means of fixing this disconnect and content discovery problem and decided to build PipFeed that finds interesting blogs and the most relevant readers for these articles for a fully customized app.

Merafuture is a social enterprise based in Islamabad. We came up with World's First AI Based Aptitude Testing mechanism to help students select an education field objectively. We have a Multidimensional Career Counselling Test (MCCT) which judges students on their personality, interest and strong knowledge areas to match them with fields which are most suited to their aptitude. We aim to make career counselling accessible and affordable to everyone in Pakistan. We dream of a Pakistan where everyone has access to equal opportunities regardless of their location, incomes status, religious affiliation and backgrounds. We started our operations in August, 2019 and have since worked tirelessly to serve students around Pakistan. The company was incepted by University Professors and Consultants with 40 years of experience among them. We saw many young undergraduates struggling with their degree and career choices. The idea was to help young students at intermediate level (O/A Levels, 9th, Matric, FA. FSC) better understand themselves so they can take an informed decision about their undergraduate degree and careers. The team at Merafuture consists of highly qualified faculty, experienced practitioners, psychologist, career counsellors, and, researchers with extensive collective experience.

AI and ML that flags potential audit or compliance risks in a document will empower users to derisk tens-of-thousands of small mistakes and errors, creating a higher plateau of compliance never seen for the common enterprise users. The tools sit on top of current operations, requiring little to no change operations risks and certainly no new 'platform' to test everyone on. The assistance slips into the background and only increases accuracy and speeds up processes already in place.

Inspiring Bangladesh Ltd. is a social good company promoting inspirational stories of Bangladeshis around the globe & the users get a voucher to inspire people. Motivated people to share their positive stories & achievements. Bangladesh has got a lot of superheroes in individual sectors, but most of them are not recognized. In fact, there are no government or private Archives or platforms for branding Bangladesh. Our main aim is to equip the students with full positivity to sound their mental health. Though Bangladesh is at her peak in the development phase and many positive minds are emerging for the betterment of the nation, still, a platform lacks where all those good deeds, good minds are highlighted at once and as a whole. In short, there is no specific branding platform to highlight all of this where all those branding are highlighted individually. It’s also a point of concern about how to highlight the proper news in this vast field of internet and media. In a word, filtering that proper news is also a point of concern. That’s where we tend to use AI and machine learning to filter that proper news from the vast source mixed with fake news. Our technology is creating nurtured under the supervision of health care, blockchain, AI, Data analysis, and social activities specialist. The technology behind this project is deep data-driven by users to analyze the psychological profile and help to become more positive and aware of personal issues, mental health care, and social issues. Our platform encourages community engagement, partnership, and affiliation, engagement with the online platform and technologies such as websites and apps, sharing authentic news and networking, highlighting inspiring stories, and promoting government achievements.

Mystery on Main Street Logo
Mystery on Main Street
1-10
Mar 1, 2020
Local small business, the kind every community has, are tired of seeing their sales slip to Amazon, eBay, and every other e-commerce site. They see "Going Out of Business" signs and mass retailers heading to bankruptcy, the effects of pandemics, and are just plain feeling the squeeze. Compounding these external challenges are their relevant internal challenges - a lack of time and resources created by an incessant work environment, to properly market and advertise their business. They rely on word-of-mouth and limited promotional methods that cannot and do not provide equitable data necessary to determine if these routines are proving valuable. Furthermore, their revenue is a product of these efforts, producing a “Catch-22” - a problematic situation created by the solution. We can help change that, sustaining local communities through local business. Mystery on Main Street is creating a unique interactive, big data marketing and advertising mobile application platform utilizing several technologies including AI (artificial intelligence), AR (augmented reality) and gamification to promote patronization of local B2C walk-in traffic “mom ‘n pops”. Each “gameplay” uses “whodunit” storylines to takes players to locations they’ve chosen to receive clues and solve a mystery, while promoting local brick and mortar business and events. Players must enter these locations with no interaction with location personnel and employees required. Our data uncovers the all important “ghost shoppers” (the “just looking” crowd) but players and participating merchants mutually gain with no membership or subscription required. The first player to solve the mystery receives a valuable prize. Think of this as Groupon meets scavenger hunt and Pokémon Go.

Venue for Menu Logo
Venue for Menu

Apr 20, 2020
Our target customers are restaurants and food service-related organizations. We are targeting restaurants, cafes, food trucks, and hotels. The idea of our application is to build the service when users can make orders in the restaurants, hotels, or from a food truck by scanning the QR code and will be redirected to the site/app to make a selection of the food. There are a few problems which we are solving with our application: 1. We are optimizing the time and effort spent by restaurants to train the personnel (waiters) and lowering the turnover 2. Reducing operational cost for the restaurants 3. Minimize interaction between people (orders will be taken through the app) which will be the huge benefit considering the current situation with a virus 4. Regular customers of the restaurants don't need to wait until the waiter will come and could put the order immediately after they made a choice or skip the line and book the table before the visit. 5. Restaurants could provide a better consistent service by focusing on the food delivery to the table and presentation rather than on taking orders (waiter could be in a bad mood or tired which can impact the service, also for immigrants it's not always easy to put the order verbally) 6. Restaurants will get the analytics built on AI and ML, which will show their top menu items, their target audience, and will provide them with metrics and predictions which will impact how the business is done. 7. Food truck drivers could take orders online, and the line will be eliminated. Because the order is done online and the driver doesn't need to spend time on taking orders, he will be able to deliver more orders hence make more profit.

Investments in ML are increasing year over year, but 87% of those models built never make it to production. That’s because data science teams are often ill-equipped with skills and tooling to handle the deployment process, which is highly time consuming and error-prone. Propheto Propheto offers a deployment ops platform that enables data science teams to, straight from their notebook or IDE, in just 5 commands, serve and maintain their ML models as production-grade applications in any cloud environment to their end customers - all done within minutes, not months. With Propheto, data science teams can finally focus on what’s really important - building the best models for their customers.

TrueSync from Flawless is the world's first system that uses Artificial Intelligence to create perfectly lip-synced visualizations in multiple languages. At the heart of the system is a performance preservation engine that captures all the nuance and emotions of the original material. Previous forms of dubbing and subtitling have proven undesirable for the majority of audiences. Often damaging and degrading the content through script changes and loss of sync. These problems create a barrier to entry to otherwise quality material. Their process untaps the film's true potential, retaining all the quality and immersion of the original. This uplift in potential audience drastically increases its given value.

SucceedSmart is disrupting the ‘traditional’ executive search industry which really has had no innovation and technology infusion for the last 50 years. Traditional executive search firms are priced exorbitantly vs the value they provide, they are very transactional in nature, lack transparency, they are exclusionary & clubby and lack diversity and are pure services plays with high operating costs which are passed on to the customers. SucceedSmart has a completely new and modern AI led approach to executive search which is simple, transparent, single blind (lending itself to diversity), speedier and very affordable. It is a double sided platform eliminating the middleman.

Filling IT and digital positions today costs companies a lot of precious time, energy and, above all, money. In times of digitalisation and skills shortages, qualified candidates are in short supply. We founded bits&birds based on the idea that companies can only successfully drive and shape the digital transformation if they quickly and efficiently find the talent that fits them 100% - professionally, personally and culturally. In line with our vision - to empower companies to independently recruit the right digital & IT professionals and leaders - we are dedicated to building the best recruiting process and an AI-driven SaaS solution. To achieve this, we combine the best of 2 worlds: Innovation, speed & agility of a tech startup and quality, trust and (20 years!) experience of an executive search agency. To achieve this, every single member of the team works on our self-developed, AI-driven software, which takes the state-of-the-art recruiting process to the next level and supports our clients in every project, no matter how challenging!

Deep Discovery is inspired by our work with the journalists who led the reporting of the Panama Papers, where we uncovered a previously unreported international nuclear trafficking ring, using only public data found across the open Web. There are thousands of similar organized crime networks going undetected, causing banks to be fined billions of dollars for letting them slip through the cracks. At Deep Discovery, we are applying AI to discover hidden patterns in raw data that reveal high-risk activity at an unprecedented global scale. We automatically generate financial crime risk assessment scores, analogous to a FICO score, for every company in the world, including their directors and officers. These risk scores will be available under a simple subscription model to be queried by banks, regulators, and journalists, with the underlying source documentation available for verification and further human analysis. No other software vendor in the marketplace today is able to generate network-based risk assessments, which is a big reason banks have been continuing to get caught doing business with bad actors and receiving massive fines.

Zaya AI AI meets diagnostics. Zaya AI is a new generation of diagnostic AI tools in pathological anatomy based on specialized data to reduce diagnostic time, laboratory costs, human error and to improve patient outcomes. Critical in helping pathologists diagnose more cases faster, they aim to develop into a true virtual AI pathology wizard that empowers pathology experts to remotely diagnose patients faster and more accurately. A multidimensional business model. To maximize accuracy and efficiency, Zaya is based on three different pillars: the medical clinic, the pathology lab and the AI tool they use to bring it all together. AI tool already performing similarly to expert pathologists. Currently, Zaya AI has a really impressive database of digitized tissue images of several pathologies, with about 500,000 cases and millions of tissue images. But the real head-turner is that their AI model has reached a performance similar to real expert pathologists. 7/9 on the NASA tech readiness scale - This means that their prototypes are tested and demonstrated in an operational environment such as hospitals and pathology labs. The potential of Zaya AI extends far beyond conventional boundaries: it’s already conquering groundbreaking strides in drug discovery, predictive therapy, and a remarkable reduction in laboratory costs, alongside an impressive threefold increase in diagnostic speed while concurrently diminishing the margin of human error by a noteworthy 30%. Mitigating the global shortage of pathology workers. From a macroscopic perspective, the deficit is glaring. Ideally, there should be 10 specialists for every 100,000 people, while the EU average is 3 pathologists, with countries like Germany where there are only 2 pathologists per hundred thousand. The consequence of talent shortage in healthcare is that it leads to late diagnoses, poorer medical care and poorer overall patient outcomes. Creating a wizard that allows faster and more accurate diagnoses could finally provide a long-term solution.

BrainScanology's proprietary technology, ShapeGenie, is a tool that will enhance a radiologist’s diagnostic intuition by 1,000X while revolutionizing shape analysis at the cellular level. We measure shape WITHOUT measuring area or volume – we can even measure left- vs. right-handedness. Geometry has waited 5,000 years for this. One of the biggest pain points for even the best radiologist is that they are not as accurate at 3pm as they are at 8am, because of mental exhaustion. The refined numbers from ShapeGenie will boost a radiologist or surgeon’s diagnostic intuition by 1,000X. Furthermore, the refined numbers will allow users to create machine learning models based on the measurements that they routinely make when diagnosing disease or assessing a candidate for surgery. In pharma and biotech, AI has reached an accuracy plateau for MRI/CT image analysis because volume and area produce very noisy data. Current AI/ML methods are bad at finding new subtypes of disease because they rely on ground truth from humans who have a hard time finding new subtypes of disease to begin with.

Sep 1, 2020
BrainWatch Tech is developing a real-time, continuous, automatic pupil reflex monitoring system for assessing the neurological status of unconscious patients in cases of traumatic brain injury, stroke, and brain surgery. The technology behind BrainWatch is an automatic monitoring system of the pupillary light reflex through closed eyes, using an optical system for image acquisition and AI for image and data analysis. BrainWatch's solution continuously monitors pupillary activity in unconscious patients through closed eyes, immediately alerting surgeons and staff to changes in the patient's condition. The system also enables pupil monitoring in real time during complex brain surgery. The product will look like a pair of virtual reality goggles, equipped with a camera lens and a light that will continuously monitor, measure, and record pupil size and reflex through the closed eyelids of patients with severe brain injury. The continuous monitoring will create a record of the patient's condition and response to treatment over time. BrainWatch Tech was established in the eHealth Ventures incubator, which fosters early-stage digital health start-ups.

Aug 11, 2020
TaxiBot's main task is to help Taxi Corporations who cannot afford to hire regular employees who work as dispatchers and answer phones. Still in many countries, such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, most journeys are ordered by phone - in peak moments it is even more than 90% of orders. Employee costs are still rising and more and more taxi corporations cannot afford their maintenance. In addition, legal regulations are changing, which require, for example: at night to have at least two people on shift when the employee is in contact with electrical devices, e.g. a computer. TaxiBot can inform the customer about the price of the ride, allows him to refuse the ride and will inform him how much the taxi going to him will cost. For many corporations in times of crisis and rising prices, it is the only way to survive on the market by reducing the costs of their operations.

Jun 2020
The Pain: Every company needs accounting. We are targeting the majority of any market which are micro and small companies which do not have access to affordable quality accounting. They require updated accounting books and filing for VAT returns, but are unable to afford full-time accountants and cannot rely on freelancers. Accounting solutions available in the market today (like Quickbooks, Freshbooks etc) require an accountant or someone with some accounting background to operate those apps, investing extra time, efforts and resources into them. This is difficult for most companies, especially SMEs and Startups in this area. The Solution: Users of The Accounter app will only upload pictures of their bills/ invoices and the AI system will take care of it via OCR and machine learning enabled system. We have a 3-level of cloud registered accountants with us, Data entry accountant (to be replaced by OCR), Maker Accountant, Checker Accountant, & Reviewer Accountant. In the future, we aim to minimize the need for cloud accountants as the system achieves the required level of machine learning. We aim to be the number one Mobile App as an accounting solution for startups, micro, and small companies.

The vast majority of chronic diseases show no symptoms until it's too late. And regular early screening is impractical because the diagnostic procedures used today are either too risky, expensive, or unreliable. We're solving these problems with artificial intelligence and existing diagnostic modalities common within clinics, imaging centers, and hospitals. Our goal is to detect common chronic disease risks at a fraction of the cost and risk to patients. By integrating with established technologies already relied upon in healthcare today, we're making it simple, safe, and affordable to detect disease risk earlier for everyone.

With features like a high resolution raw format camera, AI Dream Studio, and an adventure map, the Outtakes app has something for everyone. Whether you’re looking to capture breathtaking photos and videos, generate stunning images and animations with AI, or find your next adventure spot, the Outtakes app has you covered. In addition to the Outtakes app, we offer a range of products and services through our micro services infrastructure and codebase library, Outtakes Product Services (OPS). From powering over 25 websites for UN NGO’s and renewable energy companies, to providing software design and engineering services through our Outtakes Product Labs division, we are committed to helping businesses and organizations succeed in the digital age. At Outtakes, we believe creativity knows no bounds. We strive to provide the tools and resources necessary to help our users and clients unleash their full potential and achieve their dreams. Founded in 2020 by Justin Means, Outtakes was built to bring creative freedom to the masses and empower creation rather than consumption. We’ve focused our engineering efforts on building better ways to create and share your memories and dreams. Whether it’s through our original fluid horizontal / vertical video viewer, or advanced efforts like AI generation, our products and services cater to the creative needs of every individual. Means has spent years building out Outtakes Platform Services, OPS, a codebase library which provides a unified operating layer for platform applications. OPS makes it easier and faster for our team to deliver quality applications. With OPS, Means launched Neuraform, a binaural beats mental health app, Neurafund, an artificially intelligent finance app, Voosey, an AI architecture and rendering platform, RevoluSun, a renewable energy platform, and the Outtakes app. With the launch of Outtakes 2, Neuraform and Neurafund are being combined into the Outtakes super app to provide more value to our users and reduce our customer acquisition cost.

Jun 26, 2020
igo is next-generation delivery on-demand chat technology. Helps retailers in Latam's mid-sized cities to increase their operational capacity by enabling them to connect to their social networks and receive orders in an automated way through a super chatbot. In addition to mapping the best routes for on-demand deliveries. igo was founded in 2020, at COVID-19 by Sarita Garcia, @Gustavo Lizarazo and Ruben Hincapie, to help businesses survive their new reality: using the usual platforms and optimizing deliveries improving their sales. This led them to build Mylla, a chatbot that receives, organizes and assigns requests, for businesses in intermediate cities that are underserved by the big platforms. Today igo is working to expand to 2 Latin American countries by 2022. "Retailers have been able to multiply their sales by 3.5X in just two months of adaptation. Something that used to take them about 8 to 12 months, with igo they achieve it faster because we free them from logistical weaknesses and use the tools that they and their customers know best. Already more than 100 stores in two cities do it with igo, which is only 2% of the market we can reach," said Ruben Hincapie, co-founder and CEO of igo. This new reality has accelerated the demand for delivery services not only in capital cities but also in the intermediate cities where igo is focused. The challenge is to provide businesses with more channels to receive orders, making it simpler and more habitual. Can you imagine not only being able to connect with your brand friend, but also being able to order your transport and buy in your favorite e-commerce with just one click? So you can say: "I want a hamburger" or "I need to get to work" and in less than 15 minutes, someone will do it for you?

MiPelo also offers AI-powered specialist doctor consultations. The AI component enables the analysis of symptoms and delivers an accurate prognosis for the specialist to assess patients. This coupled with the native diagnosis and monitoring capability of HealTomy, the doctor knows about the patient's condition even before they’ve seen them, making the diagnosis quicker and sharper whilst being fully data-driven and intelligence enabled.

May 30, 2020
Augmented Vision by using AI eliminates the struggle with paper instructions. We believe that instructions for the installation process of your electronic devices should be as simple as possible. Currently customers must rely on paper instructions or call centre to troubleshoot their problems. Augmented Vision eliminates the need to struggle with paper instructions or contact a call center for help. In the effect, we reduce call center costs of telco companies and improve the user experience of the clients as well. To this achieve result, we combine artificial intelligence technologies with augmented reality. The new process of installation is simple: 1/ Receive a decoder, router or any other device from your internet provider 2/ Open the application and scan the device with your camera 3/ Using AI, the application will recognize the current status of the installation and Augmented Reality holograms will guide you step by step through the entire process. The AI will troubleshoot any issues related to the installation without the need of human contact. Trailer: https://youtu.be/zpCuJdm0v5E Our solution has successfully passed tests in selected customers of the biggest polish telco. We can report that over 84% of tested customers rated our solution as very useful for connecting and configuring equipment. Augmenred Vision solution can be seamlessly adapted to produce digital instructions beyond telecommunications - for a range of devices in additional markets: home appliance manufacturers, consumer electronics, Smart-Home. Augmented Vision solution supports 5G. Application could be delivered as a module that will be integrated with the existing application. We do not use external licenses. The artificial intelligence algorithms used in the Augmented Vision solution were built in-house. We offer a simple business model- the cost of implementing Augmented Vision at a client's site, consists of: 1/ integration with the client's existing application or production of a dedicated application (one-time cost) 2/ license for digital instruction Competitive Advantage: SYNTHETIC DATA We generate the deep learning algorithms for computer vision using synthetic data created by Virtual Reality..

Aug 17, 2020
MotivateU is an Enterprise SaaS corporation that uses artificial intelligence to provide patent-pending synchronization software and data-driven dashboards from any mobile device. Our solution is targeted at the fitness market and fills the gap between the human-driven traditional gyms and data-driven AI fitness, allowing gym owners, fitness instructors, and members to enjoy the benefits of both worlds. We use AI to enhance fitness instructors, not to replace them, because we believe it's time to put community back into community-based fitness. With 9 out of 10 Americans planning to continue to work-out from home traditional fitness is getting left behind with pen & pencil or low-tech band-aids while AI fitness is removing the human element altogether. But humans crave social connections with other humans - in fact, it's the greatest predictor of longevity. Our user interviews confirm the importance of community with 53% of people who exercise and 91% of trainers reporting that they enjoy the aspect of community and interaction with others. Our easily accessible, mobile solution does not require any hardware and allows fitness instructors to provide real-time, motivating feedback during remote, or hybrid, interactive classes, without having to stop demonstrating proper form and technique while saving countless hours on data analysis through AI generated insights and customized, actionable wellness plans. For fitness users instead of working out in front of a mirror, you can work out in front of a live fitness instructor - the same instructor you have at your local gym - while still receiving the data-driven metrics that are expected from AI fitness.

How often is history hidden in back rooms, boxes, and shelves, rarely to be seen by the public. Many stories, and media files disappear over time, losing the history that made up the world. That's why we made BondFire, a SaaS based system that focuses on assisting cities, museums, libraries, and non-profit organizations to showcase their history. We made it easy to digitize existing paper, art, video, audio, photos, and more by using advanced AI. We didn't stop there. We've also revolutionized capturing Oral Histories, associated video, audio, images, and memories. App users can access digital collections, locations, event, and more through the BondFire App. If they have additional historic content to add, capture or upload it and BondFire will suggest the history associated! Connect with others over oral histories, photos, and videos of historic events. If a historic event doesn't exist, add it to be curated by the city/museum/organization!

String is building the modern day infrastructure for delivering news media. We took a hard look at the news media market and realized there's not much innovation occurring on the delivery end - theres a lack of well designed, network enabled news platforms. We also realize that the current digital landscape wasn't built for the news industry. Platforms are configured to serve users content that entertains not informs, and consumers have trouble deciphering truth from fiction. We created a platform to get and share news from reliable sources that's configured for the news industry, and designed for the modern day news consumer.

Jun 10, 2020
Our mission at Acourant is simple, to build a safe and secure mannner in which a person can interact with their neighborhood , know their surroundings better and preserve the rights of a user. Loaded with numerous features and coupled with AI, Acourant is made to stand out in the field of social networking. The Circle of Information The Circle of Information displayed on the map lets a user know more about his neighborhood and surroundings. This circle will move along with the user and updates itself as the location changes. The number of posts in an area will be displayed inside the circle. Go Public or Go Private Acourant addresses both public and private aspects of a users post. With Acourant you can post either for public or for private. The unique combination of public, private posts makes Acourant stand out in its field. In order to connect with a user one will have to request before viewing their restricted posts. AI based Photo and Video Thumbnail selection Acourant selects the most important portion of a photo or a video to be represented as a thumbnail in the grid. This has multifold benefits, Firstly the entire concept of clickbait is completely reduced here and viewers are not fooled into clicking a video or a photo. Secondly, the thumbnail being set by an artificially intelligent system decides what is best for a user based on their interests. A New Concept of a Social Media feed Acourant addresses the feed feature by showing only the most important aspects of a photo/video in a grid to a user. Liking and commenting on a post will happen only when a user expresses interest in a post and clicks on it to give a full blown out view. Supporting Small Businesses in a Neighborhood Many small businesses have taken a hit in this pandemic. It is at this time they need our help and support. We at Acourant are doing our best in order to ensure that small businesses survive and thrive in this time. From marketing your product, recommending a new item at a nearby shop to giving small businesses more footfall, Acourant aims to make people aware of their neighborhood businesses and enable them to connect with them. Privacy Protection At Acourant we understand the privacy rights of a person and which is why the location of any user is not logged or stored in any server. The location of a user stays on their device. Only when user chooses to upload a post to a location, the coordinates at that moment is captured. All photos and videos uploaded are stored in encrypted servers and gets served on an availability basis. Your data stays safe with Acourant.

Matching 'work candidates' with 'hiring SME's.' to disrupt contract/Interim/freelance recruitment. using AI with 12-20 criteria and SM data to create the value upon employer confirmation of the match. The 'algorithm' and data engine with BI reporting deliver the value to both instantly. 'Matching us' refers to the two parties as 'us'. The engine is exactly what the 'new norm' needs to find or 'your bridge to work' where hiring firms need people now and avoid non-value added bulk notice and screening. Replace by a press of the button. The 'Platform' will arrange the intro meetings; no shows will receive a credit. The cost is pitched at a cost that represents simplicity, and like all good Asian countries '88' is good luck. We take out the luck in most cases for the employer and pass the luck to the candidate. The goal is to generate the revenue from the platform as well as offering licence models for Government agencies to 'get your country back to work' .

Glowth facilitates the process of identifying and fixing knowledge gaps on students, promoting data that benefits everyone involved in the process of learning. To extract such data, we count with an exclusive algorithm capable of mapping not only student difficulties in school subjects, but also in individual and collective abilities. Imagine a professor teaching exponentiation, however, his students cannot understand. That usually happens because of past gaps of knowledge from the student. Now, imagine that the professors delivers the student's assignment through Glowth. While students solve the exercises, Glowth is actively mapping his or her difficulties, to finally deliver a high-precision report that guides the teacher on building their classes, students on studying and coordinator on the process of managing the pedagogical sector. The process of implementation is easy, costs are the lowest on market and the efficiency and precision is high enough to predict future student's gaps. We are now selling our product directly to private schools and, in the future, we want to achieve the market of public schools as well. Launched at the Founder Institute.

Within 8 months from launch, we are already integrated with the largest fashion retailer in South East Asia and is partnering with worlds’ largest fashion retailers and brands to rebuild the online shopping fashion experiences. Studies show that shoppers are 25% more likely to convert after using our virtual dressing room. You might have heard about virtual dressing rooms applications for decades but wonder why they are still not widely adopted nowadays when everything is moving digital. The truth is: many start-ups tried, but none of them created a solution that can scale economically while maintaining the quality standards to be appealing. Revery’s co-founders have unlocked such technology through Ph.D. research and are bringing it to the market! Our core algorithm can instantly produce high-fidelity images of people wearing selected outfits only using existing catalog images. Revery’s vision is to digitize all fashion products and help people imagine themselves in their best-looking outfits. We believe that the future of fashion should be diverse, inclusive, and sustainable.

The MindKind is a software company focused on developing human-like Algorithmic Artificial General Intelligence or "AAGI". We make basic and applied research in neuroscience that sets the foundations for our ETR Functional model of the human brain. Starting from that functional model, we have developed our new ETR Cognitive Architecture, upon which we are implementing an AAGI Engine (TMK/AAGI-1). Equipped with an API, it can be easily integrated within already existing commercial devices, such as assistive robotics, personal assistants, videogames and chatbots, among many others. Our first commercial target is developing intelligent and autonomous avatars and NPC capable to work for us within any #Metaverse, and even to be mistaken for humans.

Charging your car is not a uniform, quality experience. Information is scarce and often incomplete; availability is not optimized; and access may require different means and is often unnecessarily expensive. All the plans we have for scale and stabilizing the grid with EV, cannot be built reliably on such a UX. Tap's driver app enables uniform information and payments across a huge network of chargers. Every charger in the app provides info about dynamic tariffs, AI-powered insights about availability and communication channels to share chargers efficiently. To help owners bring this driver experience to their charger network, Tap lets them connect their charger to the Tap Electric Operator Platform, at no cost - thanks to our fully automated product. This business model increases simplicity and profitability for owners.

ServiceBots Logo
ServiceBots

Nov 30, 2020
Servicebots is a Conversational AI company that is revolutionizing the way companies communicate with their customers. Servicebots helps to improve its clients' business performance by bringing them all the power of Artificial Intelligence and customized Large Language Models to help companies have more conversations, faster conversations, better conversations, and more cost-effective conversations with their customers. Servicebots' generative Voicebots can hold natural and very fluent conversations with your customers, with human like voices. Servicebots provides two Conversational AI solutions: an Omnichannel Digital Contact Center platform and a Speech Analytics platform. Through our Omnichannel Digital Contact Center platform, our Intelligent Virtual Agents (Voicebots or Chatbots) can immediately answer every inbound call or text conversation (zero wait time), 24/7, which significantly improves your customer experience. Since our Intelligent Virtual Agents can handle up to 70% of our customer’s calls, without any need for human intervention, Servicebots can help its clients reduce at least 30% of their customer services costs. On the other hand, our Voicebots can also generate massive outbound phone-based campaigns for many use cases such as sales, debt collections, appointment scheduling, on-time delivery validations, customer satisfaction surveys, etc. Our clients love the speed at which we can cover their customer databases and timely gather key market information that can be acted upon immediately. Servicebots' Intelligent Virtual Agents have successfully generated more than 20 million calls in different countries. Our Speech Analytics platform allows our clients to capture “the Voice of the Customer”. Key insights like reasons for calling, customer pains and customer sentiments and emotions are all gathered through our platform, as we provide our clients with the ability to monitor 100% of their customer contacts, as opposed to the typical 2% that can be handled manually. We can also automate your Contact Center agent performance assessment. Relevant performance aspects such as kindness, efficiency, script adherence level, objection handling abilities, and deal closing abilities are all automatically assessed in 100% of customer contacts, using AI. This automated holistic assessment can help identify “the secret sauce” of successful calls in important business functions such as sales, debt collections and customer retention. Both contextual and acoustic critical success factors of the most effective agents are quickly identified, and hence actionable insights are determined to improve contact effectiveness and impact the business performance in the short run. This also provides valuable feedback for improving agent training, reducing agent churn, and improving the agent recruitment process. We can event go as far as to being able to predict future customer behavior using acoustic AI. This allows us to forecast the probability that a customer will purchase the product or service that our client is offering (or not), honor the debt payment commitment it has just made or churn to the competition. By being able to identify “the X factor” of your most successful Contact Center Agents we can train our Intelligent Virtual Agents to be able to emulate your best human agents. Using Customized Large Language Models, we can enhance such training with best practices and provide our Voicebots with much more domain specific in-depth knowledge than a human agent can typically handle. In short, based on Servicebots’ conversational analytics abilities, we can create highly effective Intelligent Virtual Agents that are trained like our client’s best human agents, that have access to our client’s best practices and ample domain expertise, and can predict the customer’s future behavior, and can immediately answer or make any number of phone calls or customer contacts 24/7. Based on those same abilities, Servicebots also offers “Intelligent Virtual Co-pilots” that can advise its client’s Contact Center human agents to better handle the calls or customer contacts in real time. Relevant call improvement aspects like how to better handle objections, what negotiation alternatives to offer the customer, important information disclosure reminder and kindness improvement recommendations are all included in Servicebots’ Co-Pilot’s solution value proposition.

Incorrect sizes and unmet expectations on how garments fit represent not only the main drivers of returns, but also a significant discomfort for customers who typically order multiple sizes to then send the unwanted items back. This process is cumbersome for customers, detrimental for both retailers' profitability and the environment and urgent to solve. We, at DeepGears, are developing a software aiming at solving this problem. With Deepgears, online shoppers can: ● Visualize how garments truly fit on their virtual character, featuring their very same body measurements ● Find out their perfect size ● Discover DeepGears’ recommended products, empowered by advanced analytics on users’ physical trait data As a result, online consumers will shop online more easily, enjoying an experience closer to reality and ultimately return fewer unwanted items. Drawing from a successful Shopify’s case study on accessories, we have estimated that products equipped with DeepGears' software will experience a 20+% sales increase and 30+% reduction in returns. This will not only constitute an attractive value proposition to any retailer, but also reduce the immense amount of CO2 produced by the fashion industry.

Pixies Logo
Pixies
1-10
Dec 11, 2020
Pixies is a hi-tech startup that has developed a zero-impact system that combines Autonomous Mobile Robots, equipped with AI, and smart solar-powered benches, in which the robots are stored and re-charged. The system was created to solve the cleaning problem in urban contexts directly through the city. Indeed, the mobile robots are little autonomous sweepers, which are able to get around the surroundings whilst collecting waste and avoiding obstacles, both static and dynamic, to then dock inside the bench and be charged thanks to solar energy. Our aim is to develop an urban space which takes advantage of IoT devices, scattered around the city, to constantly sense and respond to the environment, while collecting useful data that will improve the management of the entire urban realm. Pixies’s strength is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning within cities, which ensures a very high level of efficiency, since it is a 24/7 on site, quick and sustainable solution. Moreover, thanks to the presence of the smart benches, we will have fixed charging stations directly installed around the city, thus giving a new piece of urban furniture, useful both for the environment and for the citizens. It's important to point out that the implementation of Pixies for cleaning purposes is only the beginning. Please, bear in mind that this system can be used within cities for a thousand other applications (delivery, first aid, mobile charging for vehicles, etc.), always remaining bottom-up, efficient and sustainable because it is embedded with the urban space. The competitive advantage of Pixies is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning. Indeed, Pixies integrates the robots directly into the city, through the use of smart benches as charging bases for them. So far, Pixies has installed the prototype of the robot and the smart bench in the courtyard of the mixed-use building ( residential, hotel and offices) where the company is based, here in Rome, making it active and supervised by ourselves every day. The system works perfectly. It's able to operate up to 8 hours per day, covering an area of 2'000 sqm, both indoor (300 sqm) and outdoor (1'700 sqm). As results, the cleaning efficiency has been increased of about 30% and the related cost has been, therefore, reduced of about 40%. Our closest competitors are : Trombia, Enway, Idriverplus, TSM. However, we can also add to these other companies that have developed solutions for the autonomous indoor cleaning. These are, for instance: Fybots,Cyberdyne, Avidbots, Adlatus and Makita.

Our flagship offering, MIC (MicroGrid Intelligent Connect), is a full-suite omnichannel CAIP, built using multiple foundational AI technologies and front-end software that enables healthcare professionals to provide patients with personalized care, support, and phenomenal customer experiences. It also equips patients with the tools and information at their fingertips to manage their own health. MIC’s CCAI is fully transactional and voice-capable, empowered to handle complex conversation scenarios with multiple queries and commands within a single conversation. This allows MIC to handle elaborate tasks like appointment scheduling, consent capturing, and adherence & service feedback without the need for contact center agents. MIC is also fully integrated with MedDRA Medical Dictionary, which allows it to identify and notify Adverse Events to the client’s pharmacovigilance team for further handling. MicroGrid, with its unique solutioning and integration of various state-of-the-art technologies, has created a truly one-of-a-kind end-to-end Health Journey solution.

We believe in Performance that’s simple, fast, and easy to use. Businesses need Automation that’s easy, ready to go, and fast to set up and use, without breaking the bank. Our founders being serial entrepreneurs having built products in the retail, and hospitality space realized the need for a robust automation solution that was cost-effective and could be implemented in weeks and not months. Several of their clients had multiple challenges in their operations, and finance departments owing to manual repetitive work which led to the loss of productivity and lack of clarity across the organization, leading to a loss of time, money, and peace of mind. This insight led to the creation of Mindful Automation. Within the first year of operations, many of their existing clients signed up for automation and saw their challenges reduce by 85% within the first three months of operation. More clients signed up for Mindful and today we cater to some of the largest restaurant chains as well as mid-sized organizations globally.

Watching a low-quality video on a large display is never a pleasant thing to do. Noise, artifacts, blur, and low resolution should be things of the past, but it's not that simple when we have preserved much of our valuable history in an old video format. Up until now, video remastering has been reserved for a very few that have access to special software, skilled professionals, and big budgets. We are introducing automated video remastering made easy for anyone. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, our remastering algorithm has learned how to remove noise, restore details, and increase resolution.

Manatee Mentor

Oct 1, 2020
Covid-19 and Artificial Intelligence have both disconnected, but also in a way brought people together closer than ever. Manatee Mentor was born exactly for that reason - in response of the need to give back in the most human way possible – solidarity. After running interviews and surveyed several dozens of professionals, the team figured out there is a real need: 80% of surveyed people shared that the value of mentoring as a strengthener of company culture is often underestimated. 70% said that top mentors as inaccessible, while 85% considered paid coaching and training unaffordable. Still....90% answered that they are ready to be mentored and to mentor others but majority couldn’t find a mentoring solution or program corresponding to their individual needs and preferences. This led to the creation of Manatee Mentor, whose goal is to be the digital platform to match mentors and mentees by making mentoring simple, trustworthy and accessible to anyone. Our vision is to transform the way people build themselves and their businesses up through values of solidarity, courage and curiosity. The team believes the solution will contribute vastly to the social sustainability in the dimensions of economic development, education, professional development and integration. Manatee Mentor offers mentoring not only for individuals and large companies but also for startups and SMEs.

Manatee Mentor Logo
Manatee Mentor

Oct 1, 2020
Covid-19 and Artificial Intelligence have both disconnected, but also in a way brought people together closer than ever. Manatee Mentor was born exactly for that reason - in response of the need to give back in the most human way possible – solidarity. After running interviews and surveyed several dozens of professionals, the team figured out there is a real need: 80% of surveyed people shared that the value of mentoring as a strengthener of company culture is often underestimated. 70% said that top mentors as inaccessible, while 85% considered paid coaching and training unaffordable. Still....90% answered that they are ready to be mentored and to mentor others but majority couldn’t find a mentoring solution or program corresponding to their individual needs and preferences. This led to the creation of Manatee Mentor, whose goal is to be the digital platform to match mentors and mentees by making mentoring simple, trustworthy and accessible to anyone. Our vision is to transform the way people build themselves and their businesses up through values of solidarity, courage and curiosity. The team believes the solution will contribute vastly to the social sustainability in the dimensions of economic development, education, professional development and integration. Manatee Mentor offers mentoring not only for individuals and large companies but also for startups and SMEs.

Our product takes current environmental data to predict in real-time how weather conditions like temperature, precipitation, and storm-size will impact crop yields and prices throughout the agricultural supply chain. Actively comparing current weather with past environmental data and corresponding historical prices, our technology uses machine learning to predict what near future prices and yields will be for different agricultural goods (Cocoa, Coffee, Almonds). Providing information through a convenient interface so different agricultural dependent businesses can pre-empt price-spikes and optimize their logistics and supply chains for the lowest cost despite price volatility. By giving businesses dependent on agricultural goods pre-emptive information on crop prices and yields we allow them to be more proactive instead of reactive, as the impacts of climate change increase agricultural price volatility.
